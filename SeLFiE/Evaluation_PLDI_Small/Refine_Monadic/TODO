TODO List

D - Done
O - Obsolete

2012-06-15
  * Manuel encountered problems with rprod Id Id and set_rel Id not being 
    simplified to Id (after refine_rcg). Can we fix these?


2012-01-28:
  D* Chapter-Structure for proof document
  * Automatic definition of generated function. Also search for REC/RECT subterms
    and generate code equations.

2012-01-26:
  D* Comment Recursion-Example
  D* Integrate Autoref in standard framework (Refine.thy)
  D* Import Collection_Bindings from Autoref_Collection_Binindgs
  D* Rename ex/Automatic_Determinization
  D* Userguide: Result extraction from det monad
  

2011-12-30:
  * n:m refinement of loops
  * n:1 refinement for total correctness.
  D* Heap memory + separation logic ... target ImperativeHOL
    (see Refine_Imperative_HOL)
  * Complete PartialFunction package integration. 
  O* More automatic concretization. Combine concretization and determinization
     to get semiautomatic procedure.
  D* Write DFS example with recursive function.

2012-01-03:
  D* Total correct fixed points are greatest fixed points. Show necessary lemmas
    by dualization. Crucial lemma is: gfp \le lfp, if body of lfp is asserted
    to stick to a well-founded relation. Shown by wf-induction for all arguments.

  D* A deterministic program can be translated to a monad with only 
    SUCCEED, result, FAIL. (A quotient of the nres-monad, with result sets of 
    maximal cardinality one). This monad is executable, code equations for
    fixed points can be generated straightforwardly by unfolding. As optimization,
    we can further translate to the option monad (former cgp) or to a 
    flat program (former cgt).
