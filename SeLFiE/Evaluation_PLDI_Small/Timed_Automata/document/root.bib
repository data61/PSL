  Abstract                 = {. We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of realtime systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many realvalued clocks . A timed automaton accepts timed words --- infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both Buchi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an ({PSPACE}) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also p...},

  Abstract                 = {We have described a scheme that allows timing assumptions to be incorporated into automatic proofs of arbitrary finite-state temporal properties. The obvious extension is to be able to prove timing properties, not just assume them. This would provide a verification framework for finite-state hard real-time systems. We conjecture that the method presented can, in fact, be extended in this way. Another major question is practicality. We believe that, with some simple program optimizations, the proposed method can be useful for certain small but tricky systems, such as asynchronous control circuits. For larger systems, approximate and heuristic methods will be needed.},

  abstract="Timed automata are a widely studied model. Its decidability has been proved using the so-called region automaton construction. This construction provides a correct abstraction for the behaviours of timed automata, but it suffers from a state explosion and is thus not used in practice. Instead, algorithms based on the notion of zones are implemented using adapted data structures like DBMs. When we focus on forward analysis algorithms, the exact computation of all the successors of the initial configurations does not always terminate. Thus, some abstractions are often used to ensure termination, among which, a widening operator on zones.",
