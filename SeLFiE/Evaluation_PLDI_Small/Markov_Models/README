Markov Models
=============

This is a formalization of probabilistic models in Isabelle/HOL. It builds on Isabelle's probability
theory (HOL-Probability). It provides formalizations for the following models:

 * Discrete-time Markov processes with measurable state spaces
 * Markov decision processes on discrete spaces
 * Continuous-time Markov chains on discrete spaces

As application of these models we formalize
 * a probabilistic model checking of pCTL formulas,
 * an analysis of IPv4 address allocation in ZeroConf,
 * an analysis of the anonymity of the Crowds protocol,
 * the reachability analysis on finite-state MDPs, and
 * expected running-time semantics for pGCL.

For the PCTL model checking we need the AFP entry Gauss-Jordan-Elim-Fun.
