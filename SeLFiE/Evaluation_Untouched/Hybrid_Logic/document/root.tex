\title{Formalizing a Seligman-Style Tableau System for Hybrid Logic}
\author{Asta Halkjær From}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This work is a formalization of soundness and completeness proofs for a Seligman-style tableau system for hybrid logic~\cite{jlog17}.
  The completeness result is obtained via a synthetic approach using maximally consistent sets of tableau blocks~\cite{aiml16}.
  The formalization differs from the cited work in a few ways.
  First, to avoid the need to backtrack in the construction of a tableau, the formalized system has no unnamed initial segment, and therefore no \textit{Name} rule.
  Second, I show that the full \textit{Bridge} rule is admissible in the system.
  Third, I start from rules restricted to only extend the branch with new formulas, including only witnessing diamonds that are not already witnessed, and show that the unrestricted rules are admissible.
  Similarly, I start from simpler versions of the \( @ \)-rules and show the general ones admissible.
  Finally, the \textit{GoTo} rule is restricted using a notion of coins such that each application consumes a coin and coins are earned through applications of the remaining rules.
  I show that if a branch can be closed then it can be closed starting from a single coin.
  These restrictions are imposed to rule out some means of nontermination~\cite{jlog17}.
\end{abstract}
