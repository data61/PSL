\title{Normalization by Evaluation}
\author{Klaus Aehlig and Tobias Nipkow}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This article formalizes normalization by evaluation as implemented in
Isabelle. Lambda calculus plus term rewriting is compiled into a functional
program with pattern matching. It is proved that the result of a successful
evaluation is a) correct, i.e.\ equivalent to the input, and b) in normal
form.
\end{abstract}

An earlier version of this theory is described in a paper by Aehlig \emph{et
al.}~\cite{AehligHN-TPHOLs08}. The normal form proof is not in that paper.
