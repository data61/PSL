# News
- We updated this repository to Isabelle2023.
- _NEW_: The introduction of **Abduction Prover**. You can watch a demo of Abduction Prover in [our YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/d7IXk0vB2p0).
- LiFtEr and Smart_Induct are no-longer supported, since their successors, SeLFiE and sem_ind, have shown superior performance.
- _PaMpeR is currently not supported either,_ since we want to minimise the cost necessary to maintain this repository. 
- This is the development version of PSL, SeLFiE, and sem_ind where we try out possibly immature ideas. In case you find problems, please send your feedback.
- The main developer of this repository, Yutaka, has taken a full-time position at a private company, and he works on [PSL and all that](https://github.com/data61/PSL/) only in his spare time. Therefore, the progress of this project, unfortunately, will be slow for the foreseeable future. In case you find problems and requests about data61/PSL, contact Yutaka (email: united.reasoning+gmail.com (reaplace + with @), twitter: [YutakangE](https://twitter.com/YutakangE)) or open an issue.

# Smart_Isabelle

This repository contains various tools to support interactive theorem proving in Isabelle/HOL using artificial intelligence.
This repository contains the implementation of *proof strategy language (PSL)* and its default strategy,
**try_hard**, for [Isabelle2023](https://isabelle.in.tum.de). Past versions of Isabelle, such as Isabelle2022-1, are no longer supported.

## YouTube

We opened [a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjnY6hIaryOEgG92udvogAw/) to introduce aspects of this project.

## Installation (of SeLFiE, PSL, and sem_ind in one go) (for MacOS/Lunux users)
1. Install [Isabelle2023](https://isabelle.in.tum.de).
2. Download or clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/data61/PSL.git).
3. Open Isabelle/jEdit with PSL and all that. You can do this by opening Isabelle/jEdit as following:
   * `(path to the Isabelle binary)isabelle jedit -d (path to the directory that contains this README file) -l Smart_Isabelle`
   * If you are a MacOS user and your current directory is this one with this README.md, probably you should type something like this in Terminal:
   * `/Applications/Isabelle2023.app/bin/isabelle jedit -d . -l Smart_Isabelle`
4. Then, You can use SeLFiE/PSL/sem_ind to your theory files
   with the Isabelle keyword, **imports** as ``imports "Smart_Isabelle.Smart_Isabelle"``.
5. Open `Example/Example.thy` to see if the installation is successful.

### Note on installation for Windows users
The basic steps are the same as MacOS and Linux. 
However, instead of using the binary file directly, use `Isabelle2023\Cygwin-Terminal` in Command Prompt. Once you start `Isabelle2023\Cygwin-Terminal`, you can install our tools by typing `isabelle jedit -d (path to the directory that contains this README file) -l Smart_Isabelle`. Note that once you started `Isabelle2023\Cygwin-Terminal`, you should not specify the path to the Isabelle binary file. Therefore, the command you need after starting `Isabelle2023\Cygwin-Terminal` is something like `isabelle jedit -d . -l Smart_Isabelle`, assuming that your current directory is this one with this README.md/

If you find it difficult to install our tool, please refer to [the Isabelle System Manual](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/system.pdf). Alternatively, you can just send an email to Yutaka at **united.reasoning+gmail.com (reaplace + with @)**.

## Hints
PSL's runtime tactic generation can result in a large number of messages in Isabelle/jEdit's output panel.
This might cause Isabelle/jEdit to pause PSL's proof search after reaching its default upper limit for tracing messages.
- One can circumvent this situation by changing the upper limit to an extreamly large number, say 99999999.
- One can change the upper limit for tracing messages via jEdit's menus:
  Plugins => Plugin Options => Isabelle => General => Editor Tracing Messages.

We presented the final goal of this project at [AITP2017](http://aitp-conference.org/2017/). Our position paper "Towards Smart Proof Search for Isabelle" is available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03037).

We are currently developing ``MeLoId``, an extension to `PSL` to improve its proof automation. Our position paper "Towards Machine Learning Induction" is available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04088). We presented this abstract at [AITP2019](http://aitp-conference.org/2019/), [LiVe2019](https://www7.in.tum.de/~kretinsk/LiVe2019.html), and [ML2019](https://icfp19.sigplan.org/home/mlfamilyworkshop-2019).

We also plan to improve the proof automation using evolutionary computation. We presented our plan during the poster session at [GECCO2019](https://gecco-2019.sigevo.org/index.html/HomePage). Our poster-only paper is available at [ACM digital library](https://doi.org/10.1145/3319619.3321921) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08468).
