   This Isabelle theory is produced using the TIP tool offered at the following website:

   This file was originally provided as part of TIP benchmark at the following website:

   Yutaka Nagashima at CIIRC, CTU changed the TIP output theory file slightly 
   to make it compatible with Isabelle2017.
   Some proofs were added by Yutaka Nagashima.*)

theorem property0_again :

  (*why "induct y" rather than "induct z"?
    \<rightarrow> Because "induct z" leads to the following step case:
    "TIP_prop_02.length (x y (cons2 x1 z)) = TIP_prop_02.length (x (cons2 x1 z) y)".
    Here we have different terms for the first argument of "x". *)

    (* This clarsimp does not rewrite "(x y (cons2 x1 z))"
       because "x" is defined recursively on the first argument.
       We can detect this problem just after applying "induct z".
       So, we cannot induct on the first argument of the innermost recursively defined function, "x".*)
