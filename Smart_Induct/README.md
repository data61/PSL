# smart_induct

## Installation
1. Install [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).
2. Download or clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/data61/PSL.git).
3. Build Isabelle/HOL with Smart_Induct from Terminal or Command Prompt using the following two commands:
   - move the current directory to the directory containing this README.md file.
      - `cd path_to_this_directory`
   - open Isabelle/jEdit with Smart_Induct.
      - `path_to_where_you_have_isabelle_in_your_system/Isabelle/bin/isabelle jedit -d . -l Smart_Induct`
3. Open `Example/Induction_Demo.thy` to check if Smart_Induct commands function as expected.

## System requirements:
- A modern computer that can handle Isabelle/HOL will do. For example, you might want to have 16 GB of memory.
