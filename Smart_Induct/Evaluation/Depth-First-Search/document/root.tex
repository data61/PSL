\title{Depth-First Search}
\author{Toshiaki Nishihara \and Yasuhiko Minamide}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Depth-first search of a graph is formalized with \texttt{function}. 
  It is shown that it visits all of the reachable nodes from a given list of 
  nodes. Executable ML code of depth-first search is obtained with code 
  generation feature of Isabelle/HOL.
  The formalization contains two implementations of depth-first search: 
  one by stack and one by nested recursion. They are shown to be equivalent. 
  The termination condition of the version with nested-recursion is shown 
  by the method of inductive invariants.
