\title{Executable Matrix Operations on Matrices of Arbitrary Dimensions}
\author{Christian Sternagel and Ren\'e Thiemann}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We provide the operations of matrix addition, multiplication,
  transposition, and matrix comparisons as executable functions over
  ordered semirings. Moreover, it is proven that strongly normalizing (monotone) orders 
  can be lifted to strongly normalizing (monotone) orders over matrices. 
  
  We further show that the standard semirings over the naturals, integers, and
  rationals, as well as the arctic semirings satisfy the axioms that are required
  by our matrix theory.
  
  Our formalization was performed as part of the \isafor/\ceta-system 
  \cite{CeTA}\footnote{\url{http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ceta}}
  which
  contains several termination techniques. The provided theories have been
  essential to formalize matrix-interpretations \cite{MatrixJAR} and
  arctic interpretations \cite{Arctic}.
  A short description of this formalization can be found in \cite{WST10}.
