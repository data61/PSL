text \<open>We compute determinants on arbitrary rings by applying elementary row-operations
  to bring a matrix on upper-triangular form. Then the determinant can be determined
  by multiplying all entries on the diagonal. Moreover the final result has to be divided
  by a factor which is determined by the row-operations that we performed. To this end,
  we require a division operation on the element type.

  The algorithm is parametric in a selection function for the pivot-element, e.g., for 
  matrices over polynomials it turned out that selecting a polynomial of minimal degree
  is beneficial.\<close>
