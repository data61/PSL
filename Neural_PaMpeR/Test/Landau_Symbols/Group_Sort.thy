  For the reification of products of powers of primitive functions such as
  @{term "\<lambda>x. x * ln x ^2"} into a canonical form, we need to be able to sort the factors 
  according to the growth of the primitive function it contains and merge terms with the same 
  function by adding their exponents. The following locale defines such an operation in a 
  general setting; we can then instantiate it for our setting.

  The locale takes as parameters a key function @{term "f"} that sends list elements into a 
  linear ordering that determines the sorting order, a @{term "merge"} function to merge to 
  equivalent (w.r.t. @{term "f"}) elements into one, and a list reduction function @{term "g"} 
  that reduces a list to a single value. This function must be invariant w.r.t. the order of 
  list elements and be compatible with merging of equivalent elements. In our case, this list 
  reduction function will be the product of all list elements.
