Lightweight Java (LJ)
=====================

Making definitions from Ott source files
----------------------------------------

a) Get Ott source, make its native executable, and put it in your PATH. The
   source can be downloaded here:

      http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/

   (The source Ott source files here were tested against version 0.20.3.)

b) Go into directory where Ott source files are located, and run "make". If you
   do not have the "make" command, run the following commands (assuming ott and
   pdflatex are in your PATH):

      ott -tex_wrap false -isabelle_inductive true \
          -merge true -o lj_included.tex -o Lightweight_Java_Definition.thy \
          lj_common.ott lj_base.ott lj.ott
      pdflatex lj.tex

c) Generated files:
   - lj_included.tex
      LaTeX output of Ott. It is included in lj.tex, which is then compiled
      with pdflatex. (We do not generate a wrapped LaTex document directly,
      since some of our tex homs are context dependent.)
   - lj.pdf
      PDF version of the LJ's definition.
   - Lightweight_Java_Definition.thy
      A valid Isabelle2011 source containing Isabelle definition of LJ.
