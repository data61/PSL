\begin{abstract}

\noindent
Pop-refinement is an approach to stepwise refinement,
carried out inside an interactive theorem prover
by constructing a monotonically decreasing sequence
of predicates over deeply embedded target programs.
The sequence
starts with a predicate
that characterizes the possible implementations,
and ends with a predicate
that characterizes a unique program in explicit syntactic form.

Compared to existing refinement approaches,
pop-refinement enables more requirements
(e.g.\ program-level and non-functional)
to be captured in the initial specification
and preserved through refinement.
Security requirements expressed as hyperproperties
(i.e.\ predicates over sets of traces)
are always preserved by pop-refinement,
unlike the popular notion of refinement as trace set inclusion.

After introducing the concept of pop-refinement,
two simple examples in Isabelle/HOL are presented,
featuring
program-level requirements, non-functional requirements, and hyperproperties.
General remarks about pop-refinement follow.
Finally, related and future work are discussed.
