\section{Introduction}

This is a formalization of {\em bounded-deducibility security} ({\em BD security}), 
a flexible notion of information-flow security applicable to arbitrary input--output automata.  
It generalizes Sutherland's classic notion of 
nondeducibility [1] by factoring in declassification bounds and triggers---whereas nondeducibility 
states that, in a system, information cannot flow between specified sources and sinks, 
BD security indicates upper bounds for the flow and triggers under which these upper bounds 
are no longer guaranteed.  

\par \ \par
BD security is introduced and discussed in detail in [2], where an application to the verification of a conference management 
system is also presented. This formalization only contains the abstract notion and its associated unwinding proof method, 
as discussed in Sections 4 and 5 from [2].
