corollary Dube_ge_d: "d \<le> Dube"
  by (simp add: Dube_def Dube_aux_ge_d del: Dube_aux.simps)

text \<open>Dub\'{e} in @{cite Dube1990} proves the following theorem, to obtain a short closed form for
  the degree bound. However, the proof he gives is wrong: In the last-but-one proof step of Lemma 8.1
  the sum on the right-hand-side of the inequality can be greater than 1/2 (e.g. for @{prop "n = 7"},
  @{prop "d = 2"} and @{prop "j = 1"}), rendering the value inside the big brackets negative. This is
  also true without the additional summand \<open>2\<close> we had to introduce in function @{const Dube_aux} to
  correct another mistake found in @{cite Dube1990}.
  Nonetheless, experiments carried out in Mathematica still suggest that the short closed form is a
  valid upper bound for @{const Dube}, even with the additional summand \<open>2\<close>. So, with some effort it
  might be possible to prove the theorem below; but in fact function @{const Dube} gives typically
  much better (i.e. smaller) values for concrete values of \<open>n\<close> and \<open>d\<close>, so it is better to stick to
  @{const Dube} instead of the closed form anyway. Asymptotically, as \<open>n\<close> tends to infinity,
  @{const Dube} grows double exponentially, too.\<close>
