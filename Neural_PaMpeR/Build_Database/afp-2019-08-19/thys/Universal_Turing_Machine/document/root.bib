@article{Joosten18,
	Abstract = {We give a procedure that can be used to automatically satisfy invariants of a certain shape. These invariants may be written with the operations intersection, composition and converse over binary relations, and equality over these operations. We call these invariants sentences that we interpret over graphs. For questions stated through sets of these sentences, this paper gives a semi-decision procedure we call graph saturation. It decides entailment over these sentences, inspired on graph rewriting. We prove correctness of the procedure. Moreover, we show the corresponding decision problem to be undecidable. This confirms a conjecture previously stated by the author [7].},

@inproceedings{Xu13,
	Abstract = {We formalise results from computability theory in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. Following the textbook by Boolos et al, we formalise Turing machines and relate them to abacus machines and recursive functions. We ``tie the know'' between these three computational models by formalising a universal function and obtaining from it a universal Turing machine by our verified translation from recursive functions to abacus programs and from abacus programs to Turing machine programs. Hoare-style reasoning techniques allow us to reason about concrete Turing machine and abacus programs.},
