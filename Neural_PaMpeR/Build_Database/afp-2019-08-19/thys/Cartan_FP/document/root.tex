\title{The Cartan Fixed Point Theorems}
\author{Lawrence C. Paulson}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Cartan fixed point theorems concern the group of holomorphic automorphisms on a connected open set of $\mathbb{C}^n$. Ciolli et al.\ \cite{ciolli-cartan} have formalised the one-dimensional case of these theorems in HOL Light. This entry contains their proofs, ported to Isabelle/HOL\@. Thus it addresses the authorsâ€™ remark that ``it would be important to write a formal proof in a language that can be read by both humans and machines.''
