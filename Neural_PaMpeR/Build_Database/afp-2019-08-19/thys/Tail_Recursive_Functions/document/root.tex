\begin{abstract}
  Tail-recursive function definitions are sometimes more straightforward than
  alternatives, but proving theorems on them may be roundabout because of the
  peculiar form of the resulting recursion induction rules.

  This paper describes a proof method that provides a general solution to this
  problem by means of suitable invariants over inductive sets, and illustrates
  the application of such method by examining two case studies.
