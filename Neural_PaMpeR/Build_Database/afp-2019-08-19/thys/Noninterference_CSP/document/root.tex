\begin{abstract}
An extension of classical noninterference security for deterministic state
machines, as introduced by Goguen and Meseguer and elegantly formalized by
Rushby, to nondeterministic systems should satisfy two fundamental requirements:
it should be based on a mathematically precise theory of nondeterminism, and
should be equivalent to (or at least not weaker than) the classical notion in
the degenerate deterministic case.

This paper proposes a definition of noninterference security applying to Hoare's
Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) in the general case of a possibly
intransitive noninterference policy, and proves the equivalence of this security
property to classical noninterference security for processes representing
deterministic state machines.

Furthermore, McCullough's generalized noninterference security is shown to be
weaker than both the proposed notion of CSP noninterference security for a
generic process, and classical noninterference security for processes
representing deterministic state machines. This renders CSP noninterference
security preferable as an extension of classical noninterference security to
nondeterministic systems.
