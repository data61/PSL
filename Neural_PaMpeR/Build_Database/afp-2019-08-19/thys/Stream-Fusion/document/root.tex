\title{Stream Fusion}
\author{Brian Huffman}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Stream Fusion \cite{CLS07} is a system for removing intermediate
  list structures from Haskell programs; it consists of a Haskell
  library along with several compiler rewrite rules.  (The library is
  available online at
  \url{http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/streams.html}.)

  These theories contain a formalization of much of the Stream Fusion
  library in HOLCF.  Lazy list and stream types are defined, along
  with coercions between the two types, as well as an equivalence
  relation for streams that generate the same list.  List and stream
  versions of \texttt{map}, \texttt{filter}, \texttt{foldr},
  \texttt{enumFromTo}, \texttt{append}, \texttt{zipWith}, and
  \texttt{concatMap} are defined, and the stream versions are shown to
  respect stream equivalence.
