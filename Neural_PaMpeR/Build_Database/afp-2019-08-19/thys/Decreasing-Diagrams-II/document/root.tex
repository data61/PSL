\title{Decreasing-Diagrams-II}
\author{By Bertram Felgenhauer}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This theory formalizes a commutation version of decreasing diagrams for Church-Rosser modulo.
The proof follows Felgenhauer and van Oostrom (RTA 2013). The theory also provides important
specializations, in particular van Oostrom's conversion version (TCS 2008) of decreasing diagrams.
\end{abstract}

We follow the development described in~\cite{FvO13}: Conversions are mapped to Greek strings, and
we prove that whenever a local peak (or cliff) is replaced by a joining sequence from a locally
decreasing diagram, then the corresponding Greek strings become smaller in a specially crafted
well-founded order on Greek strings. Once there are no more local peaks or cliffs are left, the
result is a valley that establishes the Church-Rosser modulo property.

As special cases we provide non-commutation versions and the conversion version of decreasing
diagrams by van Oostrom~\cite{vO08a}. We also formalize extended decreasingness~\cite{HM10}.
