section \<open>Complex Algebraic Numbers\<close>

text \<open>Since currently there is no immediate analog of Sturm's theorem for the complex numbers,
  we implement complex algebraic numbers via their real and imaginary part.
  
  The major algorithm in this theory is a factorization algorithm which factors a rational
  polynomial over the complex numbers. 

  This algorithm is then combined with explicit root algorithms to try to factor arbitrary  
  complex polymials.\<close>

lemma factorize_complex_poly: assumes fp: "factorize_complex_poly p = Some (c,qis)"
  shows 
  "p = smult c (\<Prod>(q, i)\<leftarrow>qis. q ^ i)" 
  "(q,i) \<in> set qis \<Longrightarrow> irreducible q \<and> i \<noteq> 0 \<and> monic q \<and> degree q = 1"
proof -
  from fp[unfolded factorize_complex_poly_def]
  obtain pis where fp: "factorize_complex_main p = Some (c,pis)"
    and qis: "qis = map (\<lambda>(r, i). ([:- r, 1:], Suc i)) pis"
    by auto
  from factorize_complex_main[OF fp] have p: "p = smult c (\<Prod>(x, i)\<leftarrow>pis. [:- x, 1:] ^ Suc i)" .
  show "p = smult c (\<Prod>(q, i)\<leftarrow>qis. q ^ i)" unfolding p qis
    by (rule arg_cong[of _ _ "\<lambda> p. smult c (prod_list p)"], auto)
  show "(q,i) \<in> set qis \<Longrightarrow> irreducible q \<and> i \<noteq> 0 \<and> monic q \<and> degree q = 1"
