subsection \<open>Factors\<close>

text \<open>Factors of a system are quotients of this system, i.e., systems that can be obtained by
a projection, forgetting some part of the dynamics. It is sometimes possible to transfer a result
from a factor to the original system, making it possible to prove theorems by reduction to a
simpler situation.

The dual notion, extension, is equally important and useful. We only mention factors below, as
the results for extension readily follow by considering the original system as a factor of its
extension.

In this paragraph, we define factors both in the qmpt and mpt categories, and prove their basic
properties.

subsection \<open>Natural extension\<close>

text \<open>Many probability preserving dynamical systems are not invertible, while invertibility is
often useful in proofs. The notion of natural extension is a solution to this problem: it shows that
(essentially) any system has an extension which is invertible.

This extension is constructed by considering the space of orbits indexed by integer numbers, with
the left shift acting on it. If one considers the orbits starting from time $-N$
(for some fixed $N$), then there is a natural measure on this space: such an orbit is
parameterized by its starting point at time $-N$, hence one may use the original measure on this
point. The invariance of the measure ensures that these measures are compatible with each other.
Their projective limit (when $N$ tends to infinity) is thus an invariant measure on the bilateral
shift. The shift with this measure is the desired extension of the original system.

There is a difficulty in the above argument: one needs to make sure that the projective limit of
a system of compatible measures is well defined. This requires some topological conditions on the
measures (they should be inner regular, i.e., the measure of any set should be approximated from
below by compact subsets -- this is automatic on polish spaces). The existence of projective limits
is proved in \verb+Projective_Limits.thy+ under the (sufficient) polish condition. We use this
theory, so we need the underlying space to be a polish space and the measure to be a Borel
measure. This is almost completely satisfactory.

What is not completely satisfactory is that the completion of a Borel measure on a polish space
(i.e., we add all subsets of sets of measure $0$ into the sigma algebra) does not fit into this
setting, while this is an important framework in dynamical systems. It would readily follow
once \verb+Projective_Limits.thy+ is extended to the more general inner regularity setting
(the completion of a Borel measure on a polish space is always inner regular).
