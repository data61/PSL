\title{Ergodic theory in Isabelle}
\author{Sebastien Gouezel}
\date{}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Ergodic theory is the branch of mathematics that studies the behaviour of
measure preserving transformations, in finite or infinite measure. It
interacts both with probability theory (mainly through measure theory) and
with geometry as a lot of interesting examples are from geometric origin.
We implement the first definitions and theorems of ergodic theory,
including notably Poincar\'e recurrence theorem for finite measure
preserving systems (together with the notion of conservativity in general),
induced maps, Kac's theorem, Birkhoff theorem (arguably the most important
theorem in ergodic theory), and variations around it such as conservativity
of the corresponding skew product, or Atkinson lemma, and Kingman theorem.
Using this material, we formalize completely the proof of the main theorems
of~\cite{gouezel_karlsson} and~\cite{gouezel_normalizing_sequences}.
