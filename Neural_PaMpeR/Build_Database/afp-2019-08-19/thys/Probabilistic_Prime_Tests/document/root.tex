\title{Probabilistic Primality Testing}
\author{Daniel St√ºwe and Manuel Eberl}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The most efficient known primality tests are \emph{probabilistic} in the sense that they use randomness and may, with some probability, mistakenly classify a composite number as prime -- but never a prime number as composite. Examples of this are the Miller--Rabin test, the Solovay--Strassen test, and (in most cases) Fermat's test. 

This entry defines these three tests and proves their correctness. It also develops some of the number-theoretic foundations, such as Carmichael numbers and the Jacobi symbol with an efficient executable algorithm to compute it.
