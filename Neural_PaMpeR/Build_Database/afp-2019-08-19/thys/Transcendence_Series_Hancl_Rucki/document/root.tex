\title{The Transcendence of Certain Infinite Series}
\author{Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki and Wenda Li}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We formalize the proofs of two transcendence criteria by J. Han\v{c}l and P. Rucki that
assert the transcendence of the sums of certain infinite series built up by sequences that 
fulfil certain properties. 
Both proofs make use of Roth's celebrated theorem on diophantine approximations to algebraic numbers 
from 1955  which we implement as an assumption without having formalised its proof.
