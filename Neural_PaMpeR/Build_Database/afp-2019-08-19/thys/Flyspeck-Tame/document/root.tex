\title{Tame Plane Graphs}
\author{Gertrud Bauer and Tobias Nipkow}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  These theories present the verified enumeration of \emph{tame} plane graphs
  as defined by Thomas C. Hales in his revised proof of the Kepler
  Conjecture. Compared with his original proof, the notion of tameness has
  become simpler, there are many more tame graphs, but much of the earlier
  verification \cite{NipkowBS-IJCAR06} carries over.
  For more details see \url{http://code.google.com/p/flyspeck/} and
  the forthcoming book ``Dense Sphere Packings: A Blueprint for Formal Proofs''
  by Hales.
