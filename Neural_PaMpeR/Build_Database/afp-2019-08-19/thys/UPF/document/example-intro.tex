In this chapter, we present a small example application of UPF for
modeling access control for a Web service that might be used in a
hospital. This scenario is motivated by our formalization of the NHS
system~\cite{bruegger:generation:2012,brucker.ea:model-based:2011}. 

UPF was also successfully used for modeling network security policies
such as the ones enforced by
firewalls~\cite{bruegger:generation:2012,brucker.ea:formal-fw-testing:2014}. These
models were also used for generating test cases using
HOL-TestGen~\cite{brucker.ea:theorem-prover:2012}.
