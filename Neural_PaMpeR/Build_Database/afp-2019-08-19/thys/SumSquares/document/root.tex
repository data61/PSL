\title{Sums of two and four squares}
\author{Roelof Oosterhuis\\University of Groningen}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document gives the formal proofs of the following results about the sums of two and four squares:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Any prime number $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$ can be written as the sum of two squares.
%\item No prime number $p \equiv 3 \bmod 4$ can be written as the sum of two squares.
%\item For any prime number $p \equiv 3 \bmod 4$ we have: $n$ can be written as the sum of two squares if and only if $np^2$ can be written as the sum of two squares.
\item (Lagrange) Any natural number can be written as the sum of four squares.
\end{enumerate}
%Note that 1--3 completely determine the numbers that can be written as the sum of two squares.\\
The proofs are largely based on chapters II and III of the book by
Weil~\cite{Weil}.

The results %1--3 already have been formalised in the proof assistant `Coq'\footnote{See \href{http://coq.inria.fr/contribs/SumOfTwoSquare.html}{http://coq.inria.fr/contribs/SumOfTwoSquare.html}} and the results 1 and 4 
have been formalised before in the proof assistant HOL Light~\cite{HOLLight}. A more complete study of the sum of two squares, including the first result, has been formalised in Coq~\cite{Thery}.
The results can also be found as numbers 20 and 19 on the list of `top 100 mathematical theorems' \cite{Wiedijk100}.

This research is part of an M.Sc.~thesis under supervision of Jaap Top
and Wim H.~Hesselink (RU Groningen). For more information see
\cite{Oosterhuis-MSc}.
