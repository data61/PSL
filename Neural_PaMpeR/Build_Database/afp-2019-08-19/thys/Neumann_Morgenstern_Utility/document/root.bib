This generalizes a previous result by Brihaye, De Pril and Schewe. We provide a number of example that separate the various criteria we explore. Our proofs are generally constructive, that is, provide upper bounds for the memory required, as well as algorithms to compute the relevant Nash equilibria."

 abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

So far, axiomatic type classes in Isabelle merely account for the logical aspect as predicates over types, while the operational part is only a convention based on raw overloading. Our more elaborate approach to constructive type classes provides a seamless integration with Isabelle locales, which are able to manage both operations and logical properties uniformly. Thus we combine the convenience of type classes and the flexibility of locales. Furthermore, we construct dictionary terms derived from notions of the type system. This additional internal structure provides satisfactory foundations of type classes, and supports further applications, such as code generation and export of theories and theorems to environments without type classes.",

                  hierarchies in a theorem prover through theory
                  interpretation. They are available for the theorem
                  prover Isabelle. In this paper, their semantics is
                  defined in terms of local theories and morphisms.
                  Locales aim at providing flexible means of extension
                  and reuse. Theory modules (which are called locales)
                  may be extended by definitions and theorems.
                  Interpretation to Isabelle's global theories and
                  proof contexts is possible via morphisms. Even the
                  locale hierarchy may be changed if declared
                  relations between locales do not adequately reflect
                  logical relations, which are implied by the locales'
                  specifications. By discussing their design and
                  relating it to more commonly known structuring

                  locales are made accessible to a wider audience

                  mechanisms include ML-style functors, type classes

abstract="It is not easy to separate the significance and influence of the Arrow--Debreu model of general equilibrium from that of mathematical economics itself. In an extraordinary series of papers (Arrow, 1951 ; Debreu, 1951; Arrow--Debreu, 1954), two of the oldest and most important questions of neoclassical economics, the viability and efficiency of the market system, were shown to be susceptible to analysis in a model completely faithful to the neoclassical methodological premises of individual rationality, market clearing, and rational expectations, through arguments at least as elegant as any in economic theory, using the two techniques (convexity and fixed point theory) that are still, after thirty years, the most important mathematical devices in mathematical economics. Fifteen years after its birth (e.g. Arrow, 1969), the model was still being reinterpreted to yield fresh economic insights, and twenty years later the same model was still capable of yielding new and fundamental mathematical properties (e.g. Debreu, 1970, 1974). When we consider that the same two men who derived the most fundamental properties of the model (along with McKenzie, 1954) also provided the most significant economic interpretations, it is no wonder that its invention has helped earn for each of its creators, in different years, the Nobel Prize for economics.",

                  principles of option pricing by arbitrage methods
                  are particularly clear in this setting. Its
                  development requires only elementary mathematics,
                  yet it contains as a special limiting case the
                  celebrated Black-Scholes model, which has previously
                  been derived only by much more difficult methods.
                  The basic model readily lends itself to
                  generalization in many ways. Moreover, by its very
                  construction, it gives rise to a simple and
                  efficient numerical procedure for valuing options
                  for which premature exercise may be optimal."

abstract="When faced with the question of how to represent properties in a formal proof system any user has to make design decisions. We have proved three of the theorems from Maskin's 2004 survey article on Auction Theory using the Isabelle/HOL system, and we have verified software code that implements combinatorial Vickrey auctions. A fundamental question in this was how to represent some basic concepts: since set theory is available inside Isabelle/HOL, when introducing new definitions there is often the issue of balancing the amount of set-theoretical objects and of objects expressed using entities which are more typical of higher order logic such as functions or lists. Likewise, a user has often to answer the question whether to use a constructive or a non-constructive definition. Such decisions have consequences for the proof development and the usability of the formalization. For instance, sets are usually closer to the representation that economists would use and recognize, while the other objects are closer to the extraction of computational content. We have studied the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, and their relationship, in the concrete application setting of auction theory. In addition, we present the corresponding Isabelle library of definitions and theorems, most prominently those dealing with relations and quotients.",
