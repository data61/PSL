section \<open>Quasiconvexity\<close>

text \<open>In a Gromov-hyperbolic setting, convexity is not a well-defined notion as everything should
be coarse. The good replacement is quasi-convexity: A set $X$ is $C$-quasi-convex if any pair of
points in $X$ can be joined by a geodesic that remains within distance $C$ of $X$. One could also
require this for all geodesics, up to changing $C$, as two geodesics between the same endpoints
remain within uniformly bounded distance. We use the first definition to ensure that a geodesic is
$0$-quasi-convex.\<close>

section \<open>The Morse-Gromov Theorem\<close>

text \<open>The goal of this section is to prove a central basic result in the theory of hyperbolic spaces,
usually called the Morse Lemma. It is really
a theorem, and we add the name Gromov the avoid the confusion with the other Morse lemma
on the existence of good coordinates for $C^2$ functions with non-vanishing hessian.

It states that a quasi-geodesic remains within bounded distance of a geodesic with the same
endpoints, the error depending only on $\delta$ and on the parameters $(\lambda, C)$ of the
quasi-geodesic, but not on its length.

There are several proofs of this result. We will follow the one of Shchur~\cite{shchur}, which
gets an optimal dependency in terms of the parameters of the quasi-isometry, contrary to all
previous proofs. The price to pay is that the proof is more involved (relying in particular on
the fact that the closest point projection on quasi-convex sets is exponentially contracting).

We will also give afterwards for completeness the proof in~\cite{bridson_haefliger}, as it brings
up interesting tools, although the dependency it gives is worse.\<close>

text \<open>The next lemma (for $C = 0$, Lemma 2 in~\cite{shchur}) asserts that, if two points are not too far apart (at distance at most
$10 \delta$), and far enough from a given geodesic segment, then when one moves towards this
geodesic segment by a fixed amount (here $5 \delta$), then the two points become closer (the new
distance is at most $5 \delta$, gaining a factor of $2$). Later, we will iterate this lemma to
show that the projection on a geodesic segment is exponentially contracting. For the application,
we give a more general version involving an additional constant $C$.

This lemma holds for $\delta$ the hyperbolicity constant. We will want to apply it with $\delta > 0$,
so to avoid problems in the case $\delta = 0$ we formulate it not using the hyperbolicity constant of
the given type, but any constant which is at least the hyperbolicity constant (this is to work
around the fact that one can not say or use easily in Isabelle that a type with hyperbolicity
$\delta$ is also hyperbolic for any larger constant $\delta'$.\<close>

text \<open>The next lemma (Lemma 10 in~\cite{shchur} for $C = 0$) asserts that the projection on a geodesic segment is
an exponential contraction.
More precisely, if a path of length $L$ is at distance at least $D$ of a geodesic segment $G$,
then the projection of the path on $G$ has diameter at most $C L \exp(-c D/\delta)$, where $C$ and
$c$ are universal constants. This is not completely true at one can not go below a fixed size, as
always, so the correct bound is $K \max(\delta, L \exp(-c D/\delta))$. For the application, we
give a slightly more general statement involving an additional constant $C$.

This statement follows from the previous lemma: if one moves towards $G$ by $10 \delta$, then
the distance between points is divided by $2$. Then one iterates this statement as many times
as possible, gaining a factor $2$ each time and therefore an exponential factor in the end.\<close>

  text \<open>The idea of the proof is to start with a sequence of points separated by $10 \delta + C$ along
  the original path, and push them by a fixed distance towards $G$ to bring them at distance at most
  $5 \delta$, thanks to the previous lemma. Then, discard half the points, and start again. This
  is possible while one is far enough from $G$. In the first step of the proof, we formalize this
  in the case where the process can be iterated long enough that, at the end, the projections on $G$
  are very close together. This is a simple induction, based on the previous lemma.\<close>

  text \<open>We separate the proof into two cases. If the path is not too long, then it can be covered by
  $2^k$ points at distance at most $10 \delta + C$. By the basic statement, it follows that the diameter
  of the projection is at most $5 \delta$. Otherwise, we subdivide the path into $2^N$ points at
  distance at most $10 \delta + C$, with $N \geq k$, and apply the basic statement to blocks of $2^k$
  consecutive points. It follows that the projections of $g_0, g_{2^k}, g_{2\cdot 2^k},\dotsc$ are
  at distances at most $5 \delta$. Hence, the first and last projections are at distance at most
  $2^{N-k} \cdot 5 \delta$, which is the desired bound.\<close>

text \<open>The next statement is the main step in the proof of the Morse-Gromov theorem given by Shchur
in~\cite{shchur}, asserting that a quasi-geodesic and a geodesic with the same endpoints are close.
We show that a point on the quasi-geodesic is close to the geodesic -- the other inequality will
follow easily later on. We also assume that the quasi-geodesic is parameterized by a Lipschitz map
-- the general case will follow as any quasi-geodesic can be approximated by a Lipschitz map with
good controls.

Here is a sketch of the proof. Fix two large constants $L \leq D$ (that we will choose carefully
to optimize the values of the constants at the end of the proof). Consider a quasi-geodesic $f$
between two points $f(u^-)$ and $f(u^+)$, and a geodesic segment $G$ between the same points.
Fix $f(z)$. We want to find a bound on $d(f(z), G)$.
1 - If this distance is smaller than $L$, we are done (and the bound is $L$).
2 - Assume it is larger.
Let $\pi_z$ be a projection of $f(z)$ on $G$ (at distance $d(f(z),G)$ of $f(z)$), and $H$ a geodesic
between $z$ and $\pi_z$. The idea will be to project the image of $f$ on $H$, and record how much
progress is made towards $f(z)$. In this proof, we will construct several points before and after
$z$. When necessary, we put an exponent $-$ on the points before $z$, and $+$ on the points after
$z$. To ease the reading, the points are ordered following the alphabetical order, i.e., $u^- \leq v
\leq w \leq x \leq y^- \leq z$.

One can find two points $f(y^-)$ and $f(y^+)$ on the left and the right of $f(z)$ that project
on $H$ roughly at distance $L$ of $\pi_z$ (up to some $O(\delta)$ -- recall that the closest point
projection is not uniquely defined, and not continuous, so we make some choice here).
Let $d^-$ be the minimal distance of $f([u^-, y^-])$ to $H$, and let $d^+$ be the minimal distance
of $f([y^+, u^+)]$ to $H$.

2.1 If the two distances $d^-$ and $d^+$ are less than $D$, then the distance between two points
realizing the minimum (say $f(c^-)$ and $f(c^+)$) is at most $2D+L$, hence $c^+ - c^-$ is controlled
(by $\lambda \cdot (2D+L) + C$) thanks to the quasi-isometry property. Therefore, $f(z)$ is not far
away from $f(c^-)$ and $f(c^+)$ (again by the quasi-isometry property). Since the distance from
these points to $\pi_z$ is controlled (by $D+L$), we get a good control on $d(f(z),\pi_z)$, as
desired.

2.2 The interesting case is when $d^-$ and $d^+$ are both $ > D$. Assume also for instance $d^- \geq
d^+$, as the other case is analogous. We will construct two points $f(v)$ and $f(x)$ with $u^- \leq
v \leq x \leq y^-$ with the following property:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:xvK}
  K_1 e^{K_2 d(f(v), H)} \leq x-v,
\end{equation}
where $K_1$ and $K_2$ are some explicit constants (depending on $\lambda$, $\delta$, $L$ and $D$).
Let us show how this will conclude the proof. The distance from $f(v)$ to $f(c^+)$ is at most
$d(f(v),H) + L + d^+ \leq 3 d(f(v), H)$. Therefore, $c^+ - v$ is also controlled by $K' d(f(v), H)$
by the quasi-isometry property. This gives
\begin{align*}
  K &\leq K (x - v) e^{-K (c^+ - v)} \leq (e^{K (x-v)} - 1) \cdot e^{-K(c^+ - v)}
    \\& = e^{-K (c^+ - x)} - e^{-K (c^+ - v)}
    \leq e^{-K(c^+ - x)} - e^{-K (u^+ - u^-)}.
\end{align*}
This shows that, when one goes from the original quasi-geodesic $f([u^-, u^+])$ to the restricted
quasi-geodesic $f([x, c^+])$, the quantity $e^{-K \cdot}$ decreases by a fixed amount. In particular,
this process can only happen a uniformly bounded number of times, say $n$.

Let $G'$ be a geodesic between $f(x)$ and $f(c^+)$. One checks geometrically that $d(f(z), G) \leq
d(f(z), G') + (L + O(\delta))$, as both projections of $f(x)$ and $f(c^+)$ on $H$ are within
distance $L$ of $\pi_z$. Iterating the process $n$ times, one gets finally $d(f(z), G) \leq O(1) + n
(L + O(\delta))$. This is the desired bound for $d(f(z), G)$.

To complete the proof, it remains to construct the points $f(v)$ and $f(x)$ satisfying~\eqref{eq:xvK}.
This will be done through an inductive process.

Assume first that there is a point $f(v)$ whose projection on $H$ is close to the projection of
$f(u^-)$, and with $d(f(v), H) \leq 2 d^-$. Then the projections of $f(v)$ and $f(y^-)$ are far away
(at distance at least $L + O(\delta)$). Since the portion of $f$ between $v$ and $y^-$ is everywhere
at distance at least $d^-$ of $H$, the projection on $H$ contracts by a factor $e^{-d^-}$. It
follows that this portion of $f$ has length at least $e^{d^-} \cdot (L+O(\delta))$. Therefore, by
the quasi-isometry property, one gets $x - v \geq K e^{d^-}$. On the other hand, $d(v, H)$ is
bounded above by $2 d^-$ by assumption. This gives the desired inequality~\eqref{eq:xvK} with $x =
y^-$.

Otherwise, all points $f(v)$ whose projection on $H$ is close to the projection of $f(u^-)$ are such
that $d(f(v), H) \geq 2 d^-$. Consider $f(w_1)$ a point whose projection on $H$ is at distance
roughly $10 \delta$ of the projection of $f(u^-)$. Let $V_1$ be the set of points at distance at
most $d^-$ of $H$, i.e., the $d_1$-neighborhood of $H$. Then the distance between the projections of
$f(u^-)$ and $f(w_1)$ on $V_1$ is very large (are there is an additional big contraction to go from
$V_1$ to $H$). And moreover all the intermediate points $f(v)$ are at distance at least $2 d^-$ of
$H$, and therefore at distance at least $d^-$ of $H$. Then one can play the same game as in the
first case, where $y^-$ replaced by $w_1$ and $H$ replaced by $V_1$. If there is a point $f(v)$
whose projection on $V_1$ is close to the projection of $f(u^-)$, then the pair of points $v$ and $x
= w_1$ works. Otherwise, one lifts everything to $V_2$, the neighborhood of size $2d^-$ of $V_1$,
and one argues again in the same way.

The induction goes on like this until one finds a suitable pair of points. The process has indeed to
stop at one time, as it can only go on while $f(u^-)$ is outside of $V_k$, the $(2^k-1) d^-$
neighborhood of $H$). This concludes the sketch of the proof, modulo the adjustment of constants.

Comments on the formalization below:
\begin{itemize}
\item The proof is written as an induction on $u^+ - u^-$. This makes it possible to either prove
the bound directly (in the cases 1 and 2.1 above), or to use the bound on $d(z, G')$ in case 2.2
using the induction assumption, and conclude the proof. Of course, $u^+ - u^-$ is not integer-valued,
but in the reduction to $G'$ it decays by a fixed amount, so one can easily write this down as
a genuine induction.
\item The main difficulty in the proof is to construct the pair $(v, x)$ in case 2.2. This is again
written as an induction over $k$: either the required bound is true, or one can find a point $f(w)$
whose projection on $V_k$ is far enough from the projection of $f(u^-)$. Then, either one can use
this point to prove the bound, or one can construct a point with the same property with respect to
$V_{k+1}$, concluding the induction.
\item Instead of writing $u^-$ and $u^+$ (which are not good variable names in Isabelle), we write
$um$ and $uM$. Similarly for other variables.
\item The proof only works when $\delta > 0$ (as one needs to divide by $\delta$
in the exponential gain). Hence, we formulate it for some $\delta$ which is
strictly larger than the hyperbolicity constant. In a subsequent application of
the lemma, we will deduce the same statement for the hyperbolicity constant
by a limiting argument.
\item To optimize the value of the constant in the end, there is an additional important trick with
respect to the above sketch: in case 2.2, there is an exponential gain. One can spare a fraction
$(1-\alpha)$ of this gain to improve the constants, and spend the remaining fraction $\alpha$ to
make the argument work. This makes it possible to reduce the value of the constant roughly from
$40000$ to $100$, so we do it in the proof below. The values of $L$, $D$ and $\alpha$ can be chosen
freely, and have been chosen to get the best possible constant in the end.
\item For another optimization, we do not induce in terms of the distance from $f(z)$ to the geodesic
$G$, but rather in terms of the Gromov product $(f(u^-), f(u^+))_{f(z)}$ (which is the same up to
$O(\delta)$. And we do not take for $H$ a geodesic from $f(z)$ to its projection on $G$, but rather
a geodesic from $f(z)$ to the point $m$ on $[f(u^-), f(u^+)]$ opposite to $f(z)$ in the tripod, i.e.,
at distance $(f(z), f(u^+))_{f(u^-)}$ of $f(u^-)$, and at distance $(f(z), f(u^-))_{f(u^+)}$ of
$f(u^+)$. Let $\pi_z$ denote the point on $[f(z), m]$ at distance $(f(u^-), f(u^+)_{f(z)}$ of $f(z)$.
(It is within distance $2 \delta$ of $m$).
In both approaches, what we want to control by induction is the distance from $f(z)$ to $\pi_z$.
However, in the first approach, the points $f(u^-)$ and $f(u^+)$ project on $H$ between $\pi_z$ and
$f(z)$, and since the location of their projection is only controlled up to $4\delta$ one loses
essentially a $4\delta$-length of $L$ for the forthcoming argument. In the second approach, the
projections on $H$ are on the other side of $\pi_z$ compared to $f(z)$, so one does not lose
anything, and in the end it gives genuinely better bounds (making it possible to gain roughly
$10 \delta$ in the final estimate).

  text \<open>We prove that, for any pair of points to the left and to the right of $f(z)$, the distance
  from $f(z)$ to a geodesic between these points is controlled. We prove this by reducing to a
  closer pair of points, i.e., this is an inductive argument over real numbers. However, we
  formalize it as an artificial induction over natural numbers, as this is how induction works
  best, and since in our reduction step the new pair of points is always significantly closer

text \<open>Still assuming that our quasi-isometry is Lipschitz, we will improve slightly on the previous
result, first going down to the hyperbolicity constant of the space, and also showing that,
conversely, the geodesic is contained in a neighborhood of the quasi-geodesic. The argument for this
last point goes as follows. Consider a point $x$ on the geodesic. Define two sets to
be the $D$-thickenings of $[a,x]$ and $[x,b]$ respectively, where $D$ is such that any point on the
quasi-geodesic is within distance $D$ of the geodesic (as given by the previous theorem). The union
of these two sets covers the quasi-geodesic, and they are both closed and nonempty. By connectedness,
there is a point $z$ in their intersection, $D$-close both to a point $x^-$ before $x$ and to a point
$x^+$ after $x$. Then $x$ belongs to a geodesic between $x^-$ and $x^+$, which is contained in a
$4\delta$-neighborhood of geodesics from $x^+$ to $z$ and from $x^-$ to $z$ by hyperbolicity. It
follows that $x$ is at distance at most $D + 4\delta$ of $z$, concluding the proof.\<close>

text \<open>The full statement of the Morse-Gromov Theorem, asserting that a quasi-geodesic is
within controlled distance of a geodesic with the same endpoints. It is given in the formulation
of Shchur~\cite{shchur}, with optimal control in terms of the parameters of the quasi-isometry.
This statement follows readily from the previous one and from the fact that quasi-geodesics can be
approximated by Lipschitz ones.\<close>

text \<open>We deduce that hyperbolicity is invariant under quasi-isometry. The proof goes as follows:
we want to see that a geodesic triangle is delta-thin, i.e., a point on a side $Gxy$ is close to the
union of the two other sides $Gxz$ and $Gyz$. Pull everything back by the quasi-isometry: we obtain
three quasi-geodesic, each of which is close to the corresponding geodesic segment by the Morse lemma.
As the geodesic triangle is thin, it follows that the quasi-geodesic triangle is also thin, i.e.,
a point on $f^{-1}Gxy$ is close to $f^{-1}Gxz \cup f^{-1}Gyz$ (for some explicit, albeit large,
constant). Then push everything forward by $f$: as it is a quasi-isometry, it will again distort
distances by a bounded amount.\<close>

text \<open>A central feature of hyperbolic spaces is that a path from $x$ to $y$ can not deviate
too much from a geodesic from $x$ to $y$ unless it is extremely long (exponentially long in
terms of the distance from $x$ to $y$). This is useful both to ensure that short paths (for instance
quasi-geodesics) stay close to geodesics, see the Morse lemme below, and to ensure that paths
that avoid a given large ball of radius $R$ have to be exponentially long in terms of $R$ (this
is extremely useful for random walks). This proposition is the first non-trivial result
on hyperbolic spaces in~\cite{bridson_haefliger} (Proposition III.H.1.6). We follow their proof.

The proof is geometric, and uses the existence of geodesics and the fact that geodesic
triangles are thin. In fact, the result still holds if the space is not geodesic, as
it can be deduced by embedding the hyperbolic space in a geodesic hyperbolic space and using
the result there.\<close>

    text \<open>We show that the distance of any point in the geodesic from $c(A)$ to $c(B)$ is a bounded
    distance away from the quasi-geodesic $d$, by considering a point $x$ where the distance $D$ is
    maximal and arguing around this point.

    Consider the point $x_m$ on the geodesic $[c(A), c(B)]$ at distance $2D$ from $x$, and the closest
    point $y_m$ on the image of $d$. Then the distance between $x_m$ and $y_m$ is at most $D$. Hence
    a point on $[x_m,y_m]$ is at distance at least $2D - D = D$ of $x$. In the same way, define $x_M$
    and $y_M$ on the other side of $x$. Then the excursion from $x_m$ to $y_m$, then to $y_M$ along
    $d$, then to $x_M$, has length at most $D + (\lambda \cdot 6D + C) + D$ and is always at distance
    at least $D$ from $x$. It follows from the previous lemma that $D \leq \log(length)$, which
    implies a bound on $D$.

    This argument has to be amended if $x$ is at distance $ < 2D$ from $c(A)$ or $c(B)$. In this case,
    simply use $x_m = y_m = c(A)$ or $x_M = y_M = c(B)$, then everything goes through.\<close>

    text \<open>This is the end of the first step, i.e., showing that $[c(A), c(B)]$ is included in
    the neighborhood of size $D0$ of the quasi-geodesic.\<close>

    text \<open>Now, we start the second step: we show that the quasi-geodesic is included in the
    neighborhood of size $D1$ of the geodesic, where $D1 \geq D0$ is the constant defined below.
    The argument goes as follows. Assume that a point $y$ on the quasi-geodesic is at distance $ > D0$
    of the geodesic. Consider the last point $y_m$ before $y$ which is at distance $D0$ of the
    geodesic, and the first point $y_M$ after $y$ likewise. On $(y_m, y_M)$, one is always at distance
    $ > D0$ of the geodesic. However, by the first step, the geodesic is covered by the balls of radius
    $D0$ centered at points on the quasi-geodesic -- and only the points before $y_m$ or after $y_M$
    can be used. Let $K_m$ be the points on the geodesics that are at distance $\leq D0$ of a point
    on the quasi-geodesic before $y_m$, and likewise define $K_M$. These are two closed subsets of
    the geodesic. By connectedness, they have to intersect. This implies that some points before $y_m$
    and after $y_M$ are at distance at most $2D0$. Since we are dealing with a quasi-geodesic, this
    gives a bound on the distance between $y_m$ and $y_M$, and therefore a bound between $y$ and the
    geodesic, as desired.\<close>
