\title{Verifying Imperative Programs using Auto2}
\author{Bohua Zhan}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This entry contains the application of auto2 to verifying functional
  and imperative programs. Algorithms and data structures that are
  verified include linked lists, binary search trees, red-black trees,
  interval trees, priority queue, quicksort, union-find, Dijkstra's
  algorithm, and a sweep-line algorithm for detecting rectangle
  intersection. The imperative verification is based on Imperative HOL
  and its separation logic framework. A major goal of this work is to
  set up automation in order to reduce the length of proof that the
  user needs to provide, both for verifying functional programs and
  for working with separation logic.

\section{Introduction}

This AFP entry contains the applications of auto2 to verifying
functional and imperative programs. These examples are published in
\cite{zhan18a}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Functional programs (in directory Functional): we verify
  several functional algorithms and data structures, including: linked
  lists, binary search trees, red-black trees, interval trees,
  priority queue, quicksort, union-find, Dijkstra's algorithm, and a
  sweep-line algorithm for detecting rectangle intersection.

\item Imperative programs (in directory Imperative): we verify
  imperative versions of the above algorithms and data structures,
  using Isabelle's Imperative HOL framework \cite{imphol}. We make use
  of separation logic, following the framework set up by Lammich and
  Reis \cite{Separation_Logic_Imperative_HOL-AFP}. The general outline
  of some of the examples also come from there.
\end{itemize}
