\title{Tensor Product of Matrices}
\author{T.V.H. Prathamesh}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this work, the Kronecker tensor product of matrices and the proofs of some of its properties are formalized. Properties which have been formalized include associativity of the tensor product and the mixed-product property. This formalization of tensor product of matrices relies on the formalization of matrices by Christian Sternagel and Rene Thiemann under the title
 `Executable Matrix Operations on Matrices of Arbitrary Dimensions'.
