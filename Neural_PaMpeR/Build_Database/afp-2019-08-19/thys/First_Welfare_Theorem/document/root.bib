Yet the applied model builder often finds the style of theoretical papers inaccessible, while the theoretician hardly recognizes the concepts used in the equations of applied models. The Structure of Applied General Equilibrium Models bridges that gap through a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical underpinnings of the applied models.},

We do so by violating the anonymity axiom common to the existing literature to establish a power dichotomy: for all but a small exceptional set of endowments, powerful agents can overcome all the others; within the exceptional set, the lesser agents can defend their resources. Once the allocations giving powerful agents all resources are included in a candidate stable set, deriving the rest proceeds by considering dominance relations over the finite exceptional sets---reminiscent of stable sets' derivation in classical cooperative game theory. We also construct a multi-good pillage game with only three agents that also has two stable sets.",

The review presented here suggests that the trend towards monetization and commodification of ecosystem services is partly the result of a slow move from the original economic conception of nature's benefits as use values in Classical economics to their conceptualization in terms of exchange values in Neoclassical economics. The theory and practice of current ecosystem services science are examined in the light of this historical development. From this review, we conclude that the focus on monetary valuation and payment schemes has contributed to attract political support for conservation, but also to commodify a growing number of ecosystem services and to reproduce the Neoclassical economics paradigm and the market logic to tackle environmental problems.

In particular the problem of the priority of proving this theorem will be considered. It is claimed that Tarski obtained this theorem independently though he made clear his indebtedness to Gödel’s methods. On the other hand, Gödel was aware of the formal undefinability of truth in 1931, but he did not publish this result. Reasons for that are also considered }

abstract="Mathematical reasoning may involve several arithmetic types, including those of the natural, integer, rational, real, and complex numbers. These types satisfy many of the same algebraic laws. These laws need to be made available to users, uniformly and preferably without repetition, but with due account for the peculiarities of each type. Subtyping, where a type inherits properties from a supertype, can eliminate repetition only for a fixed type hierarchy set up in advance by implementors. The approach recently adopted for Isabelle uses axiomatic type classes, an established approach to overloading. Abstractions such as semirings, rings, fields, and their ordered counterparts are defined, and theorems are proved algebraically. Types that meet the abstractions inherit the appropriate theorems.",
