 * objects:
 *   The objects that currently exist in the system.
 *
 * current_thread:
 *   The currently running thread. Operations will always be performed
 *   on behalf of this thread.
 *
 * ghost_state: (Used for separation logic)
 *   Which fields are owned by an object.
 *   In capDL this is all of the fields (or none of them).
 *   In any concrete state, this will be all of the fields.

(* The ghost state tracks which components (fields and slots) are owned by an object.
 * Fields + slots are encoded as None + Some nat.
