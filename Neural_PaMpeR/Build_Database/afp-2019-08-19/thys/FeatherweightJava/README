This folder contains a formalization of the type system, operational
semantics, and a proof of type soundness for Featherweight Java in
Isabelle/HOL. The development closely follows the proof originally
published in ACM TOPLAS.

Here is the description for each file:

- FJDefs.thy: definition of Featherweight Java syntax, type system,
  and evaluation relation.

- FJAux.thy: auxiliary lemmas.

- FJSound.thy: type soundness theorems.
