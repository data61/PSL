\title{An Isabelle/HOL formalisation of Green's Theorem}
\author{Mohammad Abdulaziz and Lawrence C.\ Paulson}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We formalise a statement of Green’s theorem—the first formalisation to
  our knowledge—in Isabelle/HOL. The theorem statement that we formalise
  is enough for most applications, especially in physics and
  engineering. Our formalisation is made possible by a novel proof that
  avoids the ubiquitous line integral cancellation argument. This
  eliminates the need to formalise orientations and region boundaries
  explicitly with respect to the outwards-pointing normal vector.
  Instead we appeal to a homological argument about equivalences between
  paths.
