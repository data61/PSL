	Abstract = {We consider the verification of algorithms expressed in the Heard-Of Model, a round-based computational model for fault-tolerant distributed computing. Rounds in this model are communication-closed, and we show that every execution recording individual events corresponds to a coarser-grained execution based on global rounds such that the local views of all processes are identical in the two executions. This result helps us to substantially mitigate state-space explosion and verify Consensus algorithms using standard model checking techniques.},
