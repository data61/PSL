\begin{abstract}
This entry provides an ``XML library'' for Isabelle/HOL. This includes parsing
and pretty printing of XML trees as well as combinators for transforming XML
trees into arbitrary user-defined data. The main contribution of this entry is
an interface (fit for code generation) that allows for communication between
verified programs formalized in Isabelle/HOL and the outside world via XML. This
library was developed as part of the IsaFoR/CeTA project to which we refer for
examples of its usage.
