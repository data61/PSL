\title{Affine Arithmetic}
\author{Fabian Immler}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

We give a formalization of affine forms~\cite{Stolfi2004,Girard2005} as abstract
representations of zonotopes. We provide affine operations as well as overapproximations of some
non-affine operations like multiplication and division. Expressions involving those operations can
automatically be turned into (executable) functions approximating the original expression in
affine arithmetic.

Moreover we give a verified implementation of a functional algorithm to compute the intersection of
a zonotope with a hyperplane, as described in the paper~\cite{Immler}.
