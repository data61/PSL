section \<open> The lower bound function \<close>

text \<open>
This theory defines the lower bound function @{verbatim LB} and its properties.

Function @{verbatim LB} calculates a lower bound on the number of states of some FSM in order for 
some sequence to not contain certain repetitions.

subsection \<open> Permutation function Perm \<close>

text \<open>
Function @{verbatim Perm} calculates all possible reactions of an FSM to a set of inputs sequences 
such that every set in the calculated set of reactions contains exactly one reaction for each input 
sequence.

  \<comment> \<open>Proof sketch:
     - RP calculates either the same set as R or the set of R and an additional element
     - in the first case, the result for R applies
     - in the second case, the additional element is not contained in the set calcualted by R due to
       the assumption that no state reached by a non-empty prefix of xs after vs is also reached by 
       some sequence in V (see the last two assumptions)\<close>
