\section{Introduction}

\citet[p7, exercise 6]{DBLP:books/aw/Knuth81} frames the problem like
so: given a finite set $X$, an initial value $x_0 \in X$, and a
function $f : X \rightarrow X$, define the infinite sequence $x$ by
recursion: $x_{i+1} = f(x_i)$. Show that the sequence is ultimately
periodic, i.e., that there exist $\lambda$ and $\mu$ where
$$x_0, x_1, ... x_\mu, ..., x_{\mu + \lambda - 1}$$ are distinct, but
$x_{n+\lambda} = x_n$ when $n \ge \mu$.

% Knuth exercise: Characterize $f$ that yield max and min vals of mu and lambda.

Secondly (and he ascribes this to Robert W. Floyd), show that there is
an $\nu > 0$ such that $x_\nu = x_{2\nu}$.

% Knuth observation: the X_n is unique in the sense that if X_n = X_{2n} and X_r = X_{2r}, then X_r = X_n.
% Doesn't seem essential to the algorithm however.

These facts are supposed to yield the insight required to develop the
Tortoise and Hare algorithm, which calculates $\lambda$ and $\mu$ for
any $f$ and $x_0$ using only $O(\lambda + \mu)$ steps and a bounded
number of memory locations. We fill in the details in \S\ref{sec:th}.

We also show the correctness of \citet{Brent:1980}'s algorithm in
\S\ref{sec:brent}, which satisfies the same resource bounds and is
more efficient in practice.

These algorithms have been used to analyze random number generators
\citep[op. cit.]{DBLP:books/aw/Knuth81} and factor large numbers
\citep{Brent:1980}. See \citet{DBLP:journals/ipl/Nivasch04} for
further discussion, and an algorithm that is not constant-space but is
more efficient in some situations. \citet{DBLP:journals/jam/WangZ12}
also survey these algorithms and present a new one.

\section{Concluding remarks}

\citet{DBLP:conf/vmcai/Leino12} uses an SMT solver to verify a
Tortoise-and-Hare cycle-finder. He finds the parameters \isa{lambda}
and \isa{mu} initially by using a ``ghost'' depth-first search, while
we use more economical non-constructive methods.

I thank Christian Griset for patiently discussing the finer details of
the proofs, and Makarius for many helpful suggestions.
