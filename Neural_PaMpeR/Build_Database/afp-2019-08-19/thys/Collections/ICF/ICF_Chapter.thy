text \<open>
  This chapter contains the original Isabelle Collection Framework. 
  It contains a vast amount of verified collection data structures, that are
  included either directly or by parameterization via locales.

  Generic algorithms need to be instantiated manually, and nesting of 
  collections (e.g.\ sets of sets) is not supported.
