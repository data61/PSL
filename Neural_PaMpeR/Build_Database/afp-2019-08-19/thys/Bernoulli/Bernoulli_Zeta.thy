  The analytic continuation of the exponential generating function of the Bernoulli numbers
  is $\frac{z}{e^z - 1}$, which has simple poles at all $2ki\pi$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$.

  At positive integers greater than 1, the Riemann zeta function is simply the infinite
  sum $\zeta(n) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty k^{-n}$. For even $n$, this quantity can also be
  expressed in terms of Bernoulli numbers.

  To show this, we employ a similar strategy as in the meromorphic asymptotics approach:
  We apply the Residue Theorem to the exponential generating function of the Bernoulli numbers:
  \[\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{B_n}{n!} z^n = \frac{z}{e^z - 1}\]
  Recall that this function has poles at $2ki\pi$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$.
  In the meromorphic asymptotics case, we integrated along a circle of radius $3i\pi$ in order
  to get the dominant singularities $2i\pi$ and $-2i\pi$. Now, however, we will not use a 
  fixed integration path, but we let the integration path become bigger and bigger. 
  Because the integrand decays relatively quickly if $n > 1$, the integral vanishes in the limit 
  and we obtain not just an asymptotic formula, but an exact representation of $B_n$ as an 
  infinite sum.

  For odd $n$, we have $B_n = 0$, but for even $n$, the residues at $2ki\pi$ and $-2ki\pi$ 
  combine nicely to $2\cdot(-2k\pi)^{-n}$, and after some simplification we get the formula
  for $B_n$.

  Another difference to the meromorphic asymptotics is that we now use a rectangle instead
  of a circle as the integration path. For the asymptotics, only a big-oh bound was needed
  for the integral over one fixed integration path, and the circular path was very convenient.
  However, now we need to explicitly bound the integral for a whole sequence of integration paths
  that grow in size, and bounding $e^z - 1$ for $z$ on a circle is very tedious. On a rectangle,
  this term can be bounded much more easily. Still, we have to do this separately for all four
  edges of the rectangle, which will be a bit tedious.

  We can now also easily determine the signs of Bernoulli numbers: the above formula 
  clearly shows that the signs of $B_{2n}$ alternate as $n$ increases, and we already know
  that $B_{2n+1} = 0$ for any positive $n$. A lot of other facts about the signs of
  Bernoulli numbers follow.
