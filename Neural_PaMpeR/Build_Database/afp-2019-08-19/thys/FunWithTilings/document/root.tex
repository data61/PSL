\title{Fun With Tilings}
\author{Tobias Nipkow and Lawrence Paulson}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Tilings are defined inductively. It is shown that one form of mutilated
chess board cannot be tiled with dominoes, while another one can be tiled
with L-shaped tiles.
\end{abstract}


Sections 1 and 2 are by Paulson and described elsewhere~\cite{Paulson}.
Section~3 is by Nipkow and formalizes a well-known argument from the
literature~\cite{Velleman}.

Please add further fun examples of this kind!
