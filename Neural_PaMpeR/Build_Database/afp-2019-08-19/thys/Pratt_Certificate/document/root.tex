\title{A Formalization of Pratt's Primality Certificates}
\author{By Simon Wimmer and Lars Noschinski}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  In 1975, Pratt introduced a proof system for certifying primes
  \cite{pratt1975certificate}.  He showed that a number $p$ is prime iff a
  primality certificate for $p$ exists.  By showing a logarithmic upper bound
  on the length of the certificates in size of the prime number, he concluded
  that the decision problem for prime numbers is in NP.  This work formalizes
  soundness and completeness of Pratt's proof system as well as an
  upper bound for the size of the certificate.
