\title{Partial Order Reduction}
\author{Julian Brunner}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	This entry provides a formalization of the abstract theory of ample set partial order reduction as presented in \cite{partial_order_reduction_ample_set_on-the-fly, partial_order_reduction_ample_set_verification_abstract}.
	The formalization includes transition systems with actions, trace theory, as well as basics on finite, infinite, and lazy sequences.
	We also provide a basic framework for static analysis on concurrent systems with respect to the ample set condition.
