\title{A Verified Solver for Linear Recurrences}
\author{Manuel Eberl}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Linear recurrences with constant coefficients are an interesting class of recurrence equations that can be solved explicitly. The most famous example are certainly the Fibonacci numbers with the equation $f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)$
and the quite non-obvious closed form \[\frac{1}{\sqrt 5} (\varphi^n - (-\varphi)^{-n})\] where $\varphi$ 
is the golden ratio.

In this work, I build on existing tools in Isabelle -- such as formal power series and polynomial factorisation algorithms --
to develop a theory of these recurrences and derive a fully executable solver for them that can be exported to programming languages like Haskell.
