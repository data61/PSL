\title{Octonions}
\author{Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We develop the basic theory of Octonions, including various identities and properties of the
octonions and of the octonionic product, a description of 7D isometries and representations
of orthogonal transformations. To this end we first develop the theory of the vector cross product 
in 7 dimensions. The development of the theory of Octonions is inspired by that of the theory of
Quaternions by Lawrence Paulson. However, we do not work within the type class 
\textit{real\_algebra\_1} because the octonionic product is not associative.
