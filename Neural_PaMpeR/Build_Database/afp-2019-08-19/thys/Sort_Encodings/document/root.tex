\title{Sound and Complete Sort Encodings \\for First-Order Logic}
\author{Jasmin Christian Blanchette and Andrei Popescu}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is a formalization of the soundness and completeness properties for
various efficient encodings of sorts in unsorted first-order logic
used by Isabelle's Sledgehammer tool.

The results are reported in
\cite[\S2,3]{blanchette-et-al-2013-types-conf} and the formalization itself
is presented in \cite[\S3--5]{froc}.
%
Essentially, the encodings proceed as follows: a many-sorted problem is
decorated with (as few as possible) tags or guards that make the problem monotonic;
then sorts can be soundly erased.
%
The proofs rely on monotonicity criteria recently introduced by
Claessen, Lilliestr{\"o}m and Smallbone \cite{claessen-et-al-2011}.


The development employs a formalization of many-sorted first-order logic in clausal
form (clauses, structures and the basic properties of the satisfaction relation), which could be
of interest as the starting point for other formalizations of first-order logic metatheory.
