\title{Optimal Binary Search Trees}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This article formalizes recursive algorithms for the construction
of optimal binary search trees given fixed access frequencies.
We follow Knuth~\cite{Knuth71}, Yao~\cite{Yao80} and
Mehlhorn~\cite{Mehlhorn84}.

The algorithms are memoized with the help of an AFP entry for
memoization~\cite{Monad_Memo_DP-AFP}, thus yielding dynamic programming algorithms.

\section{Introduction}

These theories formalize algorithms for the construction of optimal binary search trees
from fixed access frequencies for a fixed list of items. The work is based on the original
article by Knuth~\cite{Knuth71} and the textbook by Mehlhorn \cite[Part III, Chapter 4]{Mehlhorn84}.

Initially the algorithms are expressed as naive recursive functions
and have exponential complexity. Nevertheless we already refer to them
as the cubic (Section~\ref{sec:cubic}) and the quadratic algorithm
(Section~\ref{sec:quadratic}), their running times of their fully memoized
dynamic programming versions. In Section~\ref{sec:memo} the algorithms
are memoized with the help of an existing framework \cite{Monad_Memo_DP-AFP}.

\subsection{Data Representation}

Instead of labeling our BSTs with (ascending) keys $x_i < \dots < x_j$ we label them with
the indices of the actual keys, some interval of integers.
Functions taking two integer arguments $i$ and $j$ construct or analyze trees such that
$\textit{inorder}\ t = [i..j]$.

The access frequencies are given by two tables (functions) $a$ and $b$:
\begin{description}
\item[$a\, k$] ($i \le k \le j+1$) is the frequency of (failing) searches with a key in the interval
  $(x_{k-1},x_k)$.
\item[$b\, k$] ($i \le k \le j$) is the frequency of (successful) searches with key $x_k$.
\end{description}
