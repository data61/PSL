\title{Nominal 2}
\author{Christian Urban, Stefan Berghofer, and Cezary Kaliszyk}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Dealing with binders, renaming of bound variables, capture-avoiding
  substitution, etc., is very often a major problem in formal
  proofs, especially in proofs by structural and rule
  induction. Nominal Isabelle is designed to make such proofs easy to
  formalise: it provides an infrastructure for declaring nominal
  datatypes (that is alpha-equivalence classes) and for defining
  functions over them by structural recursion. It also provides
  induction principles that have Barendregtâ€™s variable convention
  already built in.

  This entry can be used as a more advanced replacement for
  HOL/Nominal in the Isabelle distribution.
