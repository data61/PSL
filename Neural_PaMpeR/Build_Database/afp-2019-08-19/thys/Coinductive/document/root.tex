\title{Coinductive}
\author{Andreas Lochbihler \\ with contributions by Johannes H\"olzl}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This article collects formalisations of general-purpose coinductive data
types and sets. Currently, it contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item coinductive natural numbers,
\item coinductive lists, i.e. lazy lists or streams, and a library of operations on coinductive lists,
\item coinductive terminated lists, i.e. lazy lists with the stop symbol containing data,
\item coinductive streams,
\item coinductive resumptions, and
\item numerous examples which include a version of K\"onig's lemma and the Hamming stream.
\end{itemize}

The initial theory was contributed by Paulson and Wenzel.  Extensions
and other coinductive formalisations of general interest are welcome.
