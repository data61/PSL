This folder contains works related to the formalization of
clock synchronization algorithms in Isabelle/HOL.

Here is the description for each file:

- ICAInstance.thy: this theory file formalizes the proof that
  the Interactive Convergence Algorithms (ICA) of Lamport and
  Melliar-Smith satisfies the clock axioms of Schneider's generalized
  protocol. 
- LynchInstance.thy: this theory file shows that Lundelius-Lynch
  algorithm satisfies the clock axioms of Schneider's generalized
  protocol. 
- *.ics: ICS proofs.
- *.cvc: CVC Lite proofs.
