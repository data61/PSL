	abstract = {At its core, the Document Object Model (DOM) defines a tree-like           
                    data structure for representing documents in general and HTML  
                    documents in particular. It forms the heart of any rendering engine 
                    of modern web browsers. Formalizing the key concepts of the DOM is 
                    a pre-requisite for the formal reasoning over client-side JavaScript 
                    programs as well as for the analysis of security concepts in modern 
                    web browsers. In this paper, we present a formalization of the core DOM, 
                    with focus on the node-tree and the operations defined on node-trees, 
                    in Isabelle/HOL. We use the formalization to verify the functional 
                    correctness of the most important functions defined in the DOM standard. 
                    Moreover, our formalization is (1) extensible, i.e., can be extended without 
                    the need of re-proving already proven properties and (2) executable, i.e., 
                    we can generate executable code from our specification.},
