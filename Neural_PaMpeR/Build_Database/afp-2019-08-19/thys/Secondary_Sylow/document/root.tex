\title{Secondary Sylow Theorems}
\author{Jakob von Raumer}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
These theories extend the existent proof of the first sylow theorem (written by Florian Kammueller and L. C. Paulson)
by what is often called the second, third and fourth sylow theorem. These theorems state propositions about the number
of Sylow $p$-subgroups of a group and the fact that they are conjugate to each other. The proofs make use of an implementation
of group actions and their properties.
