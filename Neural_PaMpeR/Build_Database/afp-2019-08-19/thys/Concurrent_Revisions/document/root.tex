\title{Formalization of Concurrent Revisions}
\author{Roy Overbeek}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\noindent Concurrent revisions is a concurrency control model developed by Microsoft Research \cite{burckhardt2010concurrent}. It has many interesting properties that distinguish it from other well-known models such as transactional memory. One of these properties is \emph{determinacy}: programs written within the model always produce the same outcome, independent of scheduling activity. The concurrent revisions model has an operational semantics, with an informal proof of determinacy \cite{burckhardt2011semantics}. This document contains an Isabelle/HOL formalization of this semantics and the proof of determinacy. It is part of my master's thesis \cite{overbeek2018formalizing}, which describes it in more detail.\footnote{My master's thesis was partially funded by ING, and I would especially like to thank my supervisors Jasmin Blanchette (VU Amsterdam), Robbert van Dalen (ING) and Wan Fokkink (VU Amsterdam) for their useful feedback on this work.
