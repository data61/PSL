\title{Quantifier Elimination for Linear Arithmetic}
\author{Tobias Nipkow}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This article formalizes quantifier elimination procedures for dense
linear orders, linear real arithmetic and Presburger arithmetic.  In
each case both a DNF-based non-elementary algorithm and one or more
(doubly) exponential NNF-based algorithms are formalized, including
the well-known algorithms by Ferrante and Rackoff and by Cooper. The
NNF-based algorithms for dense linear orders are new but based on
Ferrante and Rackoff and on an algorithm by Loos and Weispfenning
which simulates infinitesimals.

All algorithms are directly executable. In particular, they yield
reflective quantifier elimination procedures for HOL itself.

The formalization makes heavy use of locales and is therefore highly modular.
