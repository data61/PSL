\title{Minsky Machines%

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We formalize undecidablity results for Minsky machines. To this end, we also formalize recursive
inseparability.

We start by proving that Minsky machines can compute arbitrary primitive recursive and recursive
functions. We then show that there is a deterministic Minsky machine with one argument (modeled by
assigning the argument to register $0$ in the initial configuration) and final states $0$ and $1$
such that the set of inputs that are accepted in state $0$ is recursively inseparable from the set
of inputs that are accepted in state $1$.

As a corollary, the set of Minsky configurations that reach state $0$ but not state $1$ is
recursively inseparable from the set of Minsky configurations that reach state $1$ but not
state $0$. In particular both these sets are undecidable.

We do \emph{not} prove that recursive functions can simulate Minsky machines.
