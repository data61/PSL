\title{A Verified Compiler for\\ Probability Density Functions}
\author{Manuel Eberl, Johannes H\"olzl and Tobias Nipkow}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}%
%
Bhat \emph{et al.}\ \cite{bhat13pdf} developed an inductive compiler that computes density functions for
probability spaces described by programs in a probabilistic functional language. In this work, we
implement such a compiler for a modified version of this language within the theorem prover Isabelle
and give a formal proof of its soundness w.r.t.\ the semantics of the source and target language.
Together with Isabelle's code generation for inductive predicates, this yields a fully verified,
executable density compiler. The proof is done in two steps: First, an abstract compiler working
with abstract functions modelled directly in the theorem prover's logic is defined and proved sound.
Then, this compiler is refined to a concrete version that returns a target-language expression.

A detailed presentation of this work can be found in the first author's master's thesis~\cite{eberl}.
