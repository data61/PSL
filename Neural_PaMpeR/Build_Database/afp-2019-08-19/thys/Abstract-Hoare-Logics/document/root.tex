\title{Abstract Hoare Logics}
\author{Tobias Nipkow}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  These therories describe Hoare logics for a number of imperative
  language constructs, from while-loops to mutually
  recursive procedures. Both partial and total correctness are
  treated. In particular a proof system for total correctness of
  recursive procedures in the presence of unbounded nondeterminism is
  presented.

\section{Introduction}

These are the theories underlying the publications
\cite{Nipkow-MOD2001,Nipkow-CSL02}. They should be consulted for explanatory
text. The local variable declaration construct in \cite{Nipkow-MOD2001} has
been generalized; see Section~\ref{sec:lang}.
