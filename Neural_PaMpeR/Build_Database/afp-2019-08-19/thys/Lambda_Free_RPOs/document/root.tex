\title{Formalization of Recursive Path Orders for Lambda-Free Higher-Order Terms}
\author{Jasmin Christian Blanchette, Uwe Waldmann, and Daniel Wand}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This Isabelle/HOL formalization defines recursive path orders (RPOs) for
higher-order terms without $\lambda$-abstraction and proves many useful
properties about them. The main order fully coincides with the standard RPO on
first-order terms also in the presence of currying, distinguishing it from
previous work. An optimized variant is formalized as well. It appears
promising as the basis of a higher-order superposition calculus.

\section{Introduction}

This Isabelle/HOL formalization defines recursive path orders (RPOs) for
higher-order terms without $\lambda$-abstraction and proves many useful
properties about them. The main order fully coincides with the standard RPO on
first-order terms also in the presence of currying, distinguishing it from
previous work. An optimized variant is formalized as well. It appears
promising as the basis of a higher-order superposition calculus.
