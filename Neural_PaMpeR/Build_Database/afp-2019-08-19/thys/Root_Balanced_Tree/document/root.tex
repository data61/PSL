\title{Root-Balanced Tree}
\author{Tobias Nipkow}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Andersson~\cite{Andersson89,Andersson99} introduced \emph{general balanced trees},
  search trees based on the design principle of partial rebuilding:
  perform update operations naively until the tree becomes too
  unbalanced, at which point a whole subtree is rebalanced.  This article
  defines and analyzes a functional version of general balanced trees,
  which we call \emph{root-balanced trees}.  Using a lightweight model
  of execution time, amortized logarithmic complexity is verified in
  the theorem prover Isabelle.

This is the Isabelle formalization of the material decribed in the
APLAS 2017 article \emph{Verified Root-Balanced Trees} by the same
author~\cite{Nipkow-APLAS2017} which also presents experimental results that show
competitiveness of root-balanced with AVL and red-black trees.
