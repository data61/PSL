subsection \<open>Introduction\<close>

text \<open>
  The show-generator registers itself at the derive-manager for the class @{class show}. To be more
  precise, it automatically generates the functions @{const shows_prec} and @{const shows_list} for
  some data type \<open>dtyp\<close> and proves the following instantiation.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \<open>instantiation dtyp :: (show, ..., show) show\<close>
  \end{itemize}
  All the non-recursive types that are used in the data type must have a similar instantiation. For
  recursive type-dependencies this is automatically generated.

  For example, for the data type \<open>datatype tree = Leaf nat | Node (tree list)\<close> we require
  that \<open>nat\<close> is already in @{class show}, whereas for type @{typ "'a list"} nothing is
  required, since it is used recursively.

  However, if we define \<open>datatype tree = Leaf (nat list) | Node tree tree\<close> then also
  @{typ "'a list"} must provide a @{class show} instance.
\<close>

subsection \<open>Implementation Notes\<close>

text \<open>
  The generator uses the recursors from the data type package to define the show function.
  Constructors are displayed by their short names and arguments are separated by blanks and
  surrounded by parenthesis.

  The associativity is proven using the induction theorem from the data type package.
\<close>

subsection \<open>Features and Limitations\<close>

text \<open>
  The show-generator has been developed mainly for data types without explicit mutual recursion. For
  mutual recursive data types -- like \<open>datatype a = C b and b = D a a\<close> -- only for the first
  mentioned data type -- here \<open>a\<close> -- instantiations of the @{class show} are derived.

  Indirect recursion like in \<open>datatype tree = Leaf nat | Node (tree list)\<close> should work
  without problems.
