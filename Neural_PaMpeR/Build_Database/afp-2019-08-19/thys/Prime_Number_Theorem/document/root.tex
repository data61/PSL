\title{The Prime Number Theorem}
\author{Manuel Eberl and Larry Paulson}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This article provides a short proof of the Prime Number Theorem in several equivalent forms, most notably $\pi(x)\sim x / \ln x$ where $\pi(x)$ is the number of primes no larger than $x$. It also defines other basic number-theoretic functions related to primes like Chebyshev's $\vartheta$ and $\psi$ and the ``$n$-th prime number'' function $p_n$. We also show various bounds and relationship between these functions are shown. Lastly, we derive Mertens' First and Second Theorem, i.\,e.\ $\sum_{p\leq x} \frac{\ln p}{p} = \ln x + O(1)$ and $\sum_{p\leq x} \frac{1}{p} = \ln\ln x + M + O(1/\ln x)$. We also give explicit bounds for the remainder terms.

The proof of the Prime Number Theorem builds on a library of Dirichlet series and analytic combinatorics. We essentially follow the presentation by Newman~\cite{newman1998analytic}. The core part of the proof is a Tauberian theorem for Dirichlet series, which is proven using complex analysis and then used to strengthen Mertens' First Theorem to $\sum_{p\leq x} \frac{\ln p}{p} = \ln x + c + o(1)$.

A variant of this proof has been formalised before by Harrison in HOL Light~\cite{harrison-pnt}, and formalisations of Selberg's elementary proof exist both by Avigad \textit{et al.}\ \cite{avigad_pnt}\ in Isabelle and by Carneiro~\cite{carneiro_pnt} in Metamath.
The advantage of the analytic proof is that, while it requires more powerful mathematical tools, it is considerably shorter and clearer. This article attempts to provide a short and clear formalisation of all components of that proof using the full range of mathematical machinery available in Isabelle, staying as close as possible to Newman's simple paper proof.
