	abstract = {Our computational metaphysics group describes its use of automated reasoning tools to study Leibniz’s theory of concepts. We start with a reconstruction of Leibniz’s theory within the theory of abstract objects (henceforth ‘object theory’). Leibniz’s theory of concepts, under this reconstruction, has a non-modal algebra of concepts, a concept-containment theory of truth, and a modal metaphysics of complete individual concepts. We show how the object-theoretic reconstruction of these components of Leibniz’s theory can be represented for investigation by means of automated theorem provers and finite model builders. The fundamental theorem of Leibniz’s theory is derived using these tools.},

It presents a modular tableau calculus, in the free-variable style, treating the main domain variants of quantified modal logic and dealing with languages where rigid and non-rigid designation can coexist. The calculus uses, to this end, light and simple semantical annotations. Such a general proof-system results from the fusion into a unified framework of two calculi previously defined by the second and third authors. Moreover, the work presents a theorem prover, called GQML-Prover, based on such a calculus, which is accessible in the Internet. The fair deterministic proof-search strategy used by the prover is described and illustrated via a meaningful example.},

After introducing fragmentationalism and a paradigm case that purportedly motivates it, I criticize the view primarily on the grounds that the models and explanations it offers are at best trivial—as witnessed by examples of over-generation—and should be seen as merely re-describing in figurative terms the phenomena it is designed to account for. I also point out that fragments, as used in these theories, are not likely to be psychologically real in any robust sense and so cannot be appealed to on such grounds.},

However, a money-pump only exploits agents with cyclic strict preferences. In order to pump agents who violate transitivity but without a cycle of strict preferences, one needs to somehow induce such a cycle. Methods for inducing cycles of strict preferences from non-cyclic violations of transitivity have been proposed in the literature, based either on offering the agent small monetary transaction premiums or on multi-dimensional preferences. This paper argues that previous proposals have been flawed and presents a new approach based on the dominance principle.},

	abstract = {Are there such things as merely possible people, who would have lived if our ancestors had acted differently? Are there future people, who have not yet been conceived? Questions like those raise deep issues about both the nature of being and its logical relations with contingency and change. In Modal Logic as Metaphysics, Timothy Williamson argues for positive answers to those questions on the basis of an integrated approach to the issues, applying the technical resources of modal logic to provide structural cores for metaphysical theories. He rejects the search for a metaphysically neutral logic as futile. The book contains detailed historical discussion of how the metaphysical issues emerged in the twentieth century development of quantified modal logic, through the work of such figures as Rudolf Carnap, Ruth Barcan Marcus, Arthur Prior, and Saul Kripke. It proposes higher-order modal logic as a new setting in which to resolve such metaphysical questions scientifically, by the construction of systematic logical theories embodying rival answers and their comparison by normal scientific standards. Williamson provides both a rigorous introduction to the technical background needed to understand metaphysical questions in quantified modal logic and an extended argument for controversial, provocative answers to them. He gives original, precise treatments of topics including the relation between logic and metaphysics, the methodology of theory choice in philosophy, the nature of possible worlds and their role in semantics, plural quantification compared to quantification into predicate position, communication across metaphysical disagreement, and problems for truthmaker theory.},

	abstract = {Although most Scotch whisky is blended from different casks, a firm distinction exists in the minds of consumers and in the marketing of Scotch between single malts and blended whiskies. Consumers are offered cultural, geographical and production reasons to treat Scotch whiskies as falling into the categories of blends and single malts. There are differences in the composition, method of distillation and origin of the two kinds of bottled spirits. But does this category distinction correspond to a perceptual difference detectable by whisky drinkers? Do experts and novices show differences in their perceptual sensitivities to the distinction between blends and single malts? To test the sensory basis of this distinction, we conducted a series of blind tasting experiments in three countries with different levels of familiarity with the blends versus single malts distinction (the UK, the USA and France). In each country, expert and novice participants had to perform a free sorting task on nine whiskies (four blends, four single malts, one single grain, plus one repeat) first by olfaction, then by tasting. Overall, no reliable perceptual distinction was revealed in the tasting condition between blends and single malts by experts or novices when asked to group whiskies according to their similarities and differences. There was nonetheless a clear effect of expertise, with experts showing a more reliable classification of the repeat sample. French experts came closest to a making a distinction between blends and single malts in the olfactory condition, which might be explained by a lack of familiarity with blends. Interestingly, the similarity between the blends and some of their ingredient single malts explained more of participants’ groupings than the dichotomy between blends and single malts. The firmly established making and marketing distinction between blends and single malts corresponds to no broad perceptually salient difference for whisky tasters, whether experts or novices. The present study indicates that successfully blended whiskies have their own distinctive and recognizable profiles, taking their place in a common similarity space, with groupings that can reflect their component parts.},

	abstract = {In the standard money pump, an agent with cyclical preferences can avoid exploitation if he shows foresight and solves his sequential decision problem using backward induction (BI). This way out is foreclosed in a modified money pump, which has been presented in Rabinowicz (2000). There, BI will lead the agent to behave in a self-defeating way. The present paper describes another sequential decision problem of this kind, the Centipede for an Intransitive Preferrer, which in some respects is even more striking than the modified pump. In the new problem, the BI reasoning that implies self-defeating behavior does not rest on the controversial robustness assumption concerning beliefs in one's future rationality. This strengthens the claim that foresight cannot save the intransitive preferrer from a self-defeating course of action.},

In addition, Kim has argued that the nonreductive physicalist must give up completeness, and embrace the possibility of downward causation. This paper argues first that this extra argument relies on a principle of property individuation, which the nonreductive physicalist need not accept, and second that once we get clear on overdetermination, there is a way to reject the exclusion principle upon which the causal exclusion argument depends, but third that this should not lead to the belief that mental causation is easily accounted for in terms of counterfactual dependencies.},

It supports the standard modal logics D, T, S4, and S5 with constant, cumulative, and varying domain conditions. The most recent version also supports heterogeneous multimodal logics and outputs a compact prefixed connection proof. An experimental evaluation shows the strong performance of MleanCoP.},

	abstract = {The “School of Names” (ming jia) is thetraditional Chinese label for a diverse group of Warring States(479–221 B.C.E.) thinkers who shared an interest in language,disputation, and metaphysics. They were notorious for logic-chopping,purportedly idle conceptual puzzles, and paradoxes such as“Today go to Yue but arrive yesterday” and “A whitehorse is not a horse.” Because reflection on language in ancientChina centered on “names” (ming, words) and theirrelation to “stuff” (shi, objects, events,situations), 2nd-century B.C.E. Han dynasty archivists dubbed thesethinkers the “School of Names,” one of six recognizedphilosophical movements. The “school” is a taxonomicalfiction, however. The varied figures assigned to it—Deng Xi, YinWen, Hui Shi, and Gongsun Long, among others—never formed adistinct circle or movement devoted to any particular doctrine or wayof life, and their intellectual interests overlapped extensively withthose of the later Mohists, Zhuangzi,  and Xunzi. Several of these men were activepolitically: Hui Shi was a government minister, Yin Wen and GongsunLong political advisors and peace activists. Still, in the eyes of Hanhistorians, they devoted themselves to no signature ethical orpolitical doctrines. Hence they became known primarily for theirinterest in language and disputation and on that basis were deemed a“school.” ,  Before the Han dynasty, the social group of which these thinkers werea part was known as the bianzhe—“disputers” or“dialecticians”—because they spent much of theirtime in “disputation” (bian, also“discrimination” or “distinction drawing”), aform of dialectical persuasion and inquiry aimed fundamentally at“distinguishing” the proper semantic relations betweennames and the things or kinds of things to which theyrefer. “Disputers” is thus probably a more appropriateEnglish label for Hui Shi, Gongsun Long, and the others than is the“School of Names,” though it refers not specifically tothese figures but to the broader class of scholars to which theybelonged. (“Name-distinguishers” or“distinction-disputers” would be even more accurate,though these terms are too clumsy to adopt as English equivalents.)The disputers flourished for about a century and a half as wanderingpolitical advisors, counseling rulers throughout pre-unificationChina. They disappeared with the onset of the Qin dynasty (221 B.C.E.),partly because the political and intellectual climate of the newempire was hostile to their purely theoretical, occasionally flippantinquiries, and partly because with unification their politicalservices became obsolete.},

This paper focuses on Larry Temkin's argument in "Intransitivity and the Mere Addition Paradox." Although his argument is not aimed just at utilitarians or even consequentialists in general, it is of prticular significance to consequentialists. If 'all-things-considered better than' does not obey transitivity, there may be choice situations in which there is no optimal choice, which would seem to open the door to a consequentialist account of moral dilemmas. Temkin's argument crucially appeals to what he calls "the Person-Affecting Principle (PAP)", which he roughly characterizes as follows, "On PAP, one outcome is worse than another only if it affects people for the worse" This paper argues that PAP, although plausible, does not hold in precisely those situations in which it would have to hold in order for Temkin's argument against transitivity to work.},

	abstract = {'This doctoral thesis is an examination, and vindication, of a position that has been identified with the expression 'aesthetic empiricism' and typically captured by the claim that 'what is aesthetically valuable in a painting can be detected merely by looking at it - features that cannot be so detected are not properly aesthetic ones' (Currie, 1989). Such a position continues to be a focus for contemporary discussion (e.g., Davies, 2004, 2006, and Graham, 2006), yet it is far from clear precisely what it entails or even who subscribes to it. All that seems to have been agreed is that aesthetic empiricism is false, demonstrably so in the light of Walton's claims in 'Categories of Art' (1970), and Danto's work on indiscernibles (1981). The lack of theoretical clarity would suffice to motivate a closer look at aesthetic empiricism; however, the more specific target of this thesis isÃ‚Â· to show that the received treatment is mistaken - aesthetic empiricism, once clearly identified, can be seen to be both intuitive and beguiling. It earns our philosophical consideration by providing a formidable accoiint ofthe aesthetic and also a valuable contribution to our understanding of art criticism.},

	abstract = {My focus is on pragmatic arguments for various ‘rationality constraints’ on a decision maker’s state of mind: on his beliefs or preferences. An argument of this kind purports to show that a violator of a given constraint can be exposed to a decision problem in which he will act to his guaranteed disadvantage. Dramatically put, he can be exploited by a clever bookie who doesn’t know more than the agent himself. Examples of pragmatic arguments of this kind are synchronic Dutch Books, for the standard probability axioms, diachronic Dutch Books, for the more controversial principles of reflection and conditionalization, and Money Pumps, for the transitivity requirement on preferences.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}
The proposed exploitation set-ups share a common feature. If the violator of a given constraint is logically and mathematically competent, he can be exploited only if he is disunified in his decision-making. Exploitation is possible only if the agent makes decisions on various issues he confronts one by one, rather than on all of them together. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}
Unity in decision making may be quite costly and is often inconvenient, especially when it concerns opportunity packages that are spread over time. On my view, therefore, pragmatic arguments should be seen as delivering conditional conclusions: “If you want to afford being disunified as a decision maker, then you’d better satisfy these constraints.” The arguments of this kind fail to establish the inherent rationality of the constraints under consideration. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}
Levi’s view of the status of pragmatic arguments (cf. Levi 2002) is opposed to mine. According to him, only synchronic pragmatic arguments are valid (indeed, categorically valid). The diachronic ones, he argues, lack any validity at all. This line of reasoning is questioned in my paper.},

If Weber-Fechner law is the result of natural selection, then the logarithmic scale should be better, in some sense, than other biologically feasible scales.

	abstract = {We present an automated verification of the well-known modal logic cube in Isabelle/HOL, in which we prove the inclusion relations between the cube's logics using automated reasoning tools. Prior work addresses this problem but without restriction to the modal logic cube, and using encodings in first-order logic in combination with first-order automated theorem provers. In contrast, our solution is more elegant, transparent and effective. It employs an embedding of quantified modal logic in classical higher-order logic. Automated reasoning tools, such as Sledgehammer with LEO-II, Satallax and CVC4, Metis and Nitpick, are employed to achieve full automation. Though successful, the experiments also motivate some technical improvements in the Isabelle/HOL tool.},

I will explain how the use of our concepts motivates the inference rules of the sequent calculus, and then show that the completeness of the calculus for Davies–Humberstone models explains why those concepts have the structure described by those models.

Composers in a wide range of styles have exploited the non-Euclidean geometry of these spaces, typically by using short line segments between structurally similar chords. Such line segments exist only when chords are nearly symmetrical under translation, reflection, or permutation. Paradigmatically consonant and dissonant chords possess different near-symmetries and suggest different musical uses.
Chords can be mapped as points onto a many-fold surface, on which consonant chords cluster together, connected by melodic lines that reveal western harmony and counterpoint.

We then offer a detailed preparatory study of the basic concepts involved in Anselm’s argument. Next, we present our own reconstructions—one in modal logic and one in classical logic—and compare them with each other and with existing reconstructions from the reviewed literature. Finally, we try to show why and how one can gain a better understanding of Anselm’s argument by using modern formal logic. In particular, we try to explain why formal reconstructions of the argument, despite its apparent simplicity, tend to become quite involved.},
