\begin{abstract}
 We study three different Hoare logics for reasoning about time bounds of
  imperative programs and formalize them in Isabelle/HOL: a classical Hoare
  like logic due to Nielson, a logic with potentials due to Carbonneaux \emph{et
    al.} and a \emph{separation logic} following work by Atkey, Chagu\'erand
  and Pottier.  These logics are formally shown to be sound and complete.
  Verification condition generators are developed and are shown sound and
  complete too.  We also consider variants of the systems where we abstract
  from multiplicative constants in the running time bounds, thus supporting a
  big-O style of reasoning.  Finally we compare the expressive power of the
  three systems.   

An informal description is found in an accompanying report \cite{HaslbeckN-TACAS18}.
