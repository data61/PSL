\title{The Localization of a Commutative Ring}
\author{Anthony Bordg}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We formalize the localization~\cite[II, \S4]{SL-Alg} of a commutative ring $R$ with respect to a multiplicative subset (i.e. a submonoid of $R$ seen as a multiplicative monoid). \\ This localization is itself a commutative ring and we build the natural homomorphism of rings from $R$ to its localization.
