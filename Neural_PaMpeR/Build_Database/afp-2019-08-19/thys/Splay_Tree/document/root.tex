\title{Splay Tree}
\author{Tobias Nipkow}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Splay trees are self-adjusting binary search trees which were
invented by Sleator and Tarjan~\cite{SleatorT-JACM85}.
This entry provides executable and verified functional splay trees
as well as the related splay heaps due to Okasaki~\cite{Okasaki}.

The amortized complexity of splay trees and heaps is analyzed in the AFP entry
\href{http://isa-afp.org/entries/Amortized_Complexity.shtml}{Amortized Complexity}.
