\title{Abstract Interpretation of Annotated Commands}
\author{Tobias Nipkow}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is the Isabelle formalization of the material decribed in the
eponymous  ITP paper~\cite{Nipkow-ITP12}. It develops a generic abstract interpreter for a
while-language, including widening and narrowing. The collecting
semantics and the abstract interpreter operate on annotated commands:
the program is represented as a syntax tree with the semantic
information directly embedded, without auxiliary labels. The aim of
the formalization is simplicity, not efficiency or
precision. This is motivated by the inclusion of the material in a
theorem prover based course on semantics. A similar (but more
polished) development is covered in~\cite{Concrete}.
