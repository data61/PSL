\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This Isabelle/HOL formalization introduces a nested multiset datatype and
defines Dershowitz and Manna's nested multiset order. The order is proved well
founded and linear. By removing one constructor, we transform the nested
multisets into hereditary multisets. These are isomorphic to the syntactic
ordinals---the ordinals can be recursively expressed in Cantor normal form.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and linear orders are provided on this
type.

\section{Introduction}

This Isabelle/HOL formalization introduces a nested multiset datatype and
defines Dershowitz and Manna's nested multiset order. The order is proved well
founded and linear. By removing one constructor, we transform the nested
multisets into hereditary multisets. These are isomorphic to the syntactic
ordinals---the ordinals can be recursively expressed in Cantor normal form.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and linear orders are provided on this
type.

In addition, signed (or hybrid) multisets are provided (i.e., multisets with
potentially negative multiplicities), as well as signed hereditary multisets
and signed ordinals (e.g., $\omega^2 - 2\omega + 1$).
