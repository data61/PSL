\title{G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorems}
\author{Lawrence C. Paulson}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
G\"odel's two incompleteness theorems \cite{goedel-I} are formalised, following a careful presentation by {\'S}wierczkowski \cite{swierczkowski-finite}, in the theory of hereditarily finite sets. This represents the first ever machine-assisted proof of the second incompleteness theorem. Compared with traditional formalisations using Peano arithmetic \cite{boolos-provability}, coding is simpler, with no need to formalise the notion of multiplication (let alone that of a prime number) in the formalised calculus upon which the theorem is based. 
However, other technical problems had to be solved in order to complete the argument.
