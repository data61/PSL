\title{One Part of Shannon's Source Coding Theorem}
\author{Quentin Hibon}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This document contains a proof of the necessary condition on the code rate of
  a source code, namely that this code rate is bounded by the entropy of the
  source. This represents one half of Shannon's source coding theorem, which is
  itself an equivalence.

  This proof is taken directly from the textbook \cite{ref},
  and transcribed rather literally into Isabelle. It is thus easier to keep the
  textbook proof in mind to understand this formal proof.
