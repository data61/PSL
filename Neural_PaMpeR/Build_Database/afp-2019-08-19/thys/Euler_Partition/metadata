abstract =
  Euler's Partition Theorem states that the number of partitions with only
  distinct parts is equal to the number of partitions with only odd parts.
  The combinatorial proof follows John Harrison's HOL Light formalization.
  This theorem is the 45th theorem of the Top 100 Theorems list.
