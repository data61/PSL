    (* NOTES for sequents, had to prove a few lemmas to import the
       permutation stuff from the HOL lib. The few lemmas easily prove
       A <~~> B for typical A and B by reducing to element
       counts. This also fixes a todo in Permutation.thy - we can
       reduce perms to counts, and multisets could already be reduced
       to counts. Thus A <~~> B = (multiset_of A = multiset_of B) is
       easy. *)
