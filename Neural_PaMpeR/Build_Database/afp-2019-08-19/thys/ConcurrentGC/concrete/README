This directory contains the following three files.

- Main.hs
- WriteDotFile.hs
- input_heap.txt

Main.hs and WriteDotFile.hs generates an executable that takes
an input file and returns an output file whose extention is .dot.

input_heap.txt is an example of input file.

Input files are converted to pdf files by using Graphviz.
Suppose the executable has generated output.dot, and Graphviz is
installed properly, Graphviz generates a pdf file whose name is
output.pdf from the following command:

  dot -Tpdf input.dot -o output.pdf

The input file for the executable should follow the specific format
that described in the following.

The input file consists of two parts.
The first part describes the mutators and the lines starting from
mutators.

  0 1 2 3
  1 3
  2 2 5

stands for the following:
There are three mutators called 0, 1, 2, respectively. The mutator 1
has references to the object 1, 2, and 3. The mutator 1 has a
reference to the object 3. The mutator 2 has references to the
object 2 and 5.

The first and second parts are split by "--".

The second part describes the objects and the lines starting from
obejcts.

  0
  1
  2
  3 0 1 1 2
  4
  5

stands for the following:
There are six objects called 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively. The
objecct 3 has two fields called 0 and 1 respecitvely. In the field
0, a reference to the object 1 is stored, while the field 1 contains
a reference to the object 2.
