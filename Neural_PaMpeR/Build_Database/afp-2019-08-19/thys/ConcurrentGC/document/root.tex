\title{Relaxing Safely: Verified On-the-Fly Garbage Collection for x86-TSO}
\author{Peter Gammie, Tony Hosking and Kai Engelhardt}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  CIMP extends the small imperative language IMP with synchronous
  message passing.

  We use CIMP to model Schism, a state-of-the-art real-time garbage
  collection scheme for weak memory, and show that it is safe on
  x86-TSO.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

We verify the memory safety of one of the Schism garbage collectors as
developed by \citet{Pizlo+2010PLDI,Pizlo201xPhd} with respect to the
x86-TSO model (a total store order memory model for modern multicore
Intel x86 architectures) developed and validated by
\citet{DBLP:journals/cacm/SewellSONM10}.

Our development is inspired by the original work on the verification
of concurrent mark/sweep collectors by
\citet{DBLP:journals/cacm/DijkstraLMSS78}, and the more realistic
models and proofs of \citet{DBLP:conf/popl/DoligezG94}. We leave a
thorough survey of formal garbage collection verification to future
work.

We present our model of the
garbage collector in \S\ref{sec:gc-model}, the detailed invariants in
\S\ref{sec:gc-invs}, and the high-level safety results in
\S\ref{sec:top-level-correctness}. This bottom-up presentation is how
we developed the proof; we have resisted the urge to hide the bodies
with a rational reconstruction, partly because we expect the current
structure to more readily support extensions and revisions.

This document does not include the formal proofs that the model
satisfies these invariants; the curious reader is encouraged to peruse
the Isabelle sources.

For details about the modelling language CIMP used in this development,
see the separate AFP entry ConcurrentIMP \citep{ConcurrentIMP_AFP}.
