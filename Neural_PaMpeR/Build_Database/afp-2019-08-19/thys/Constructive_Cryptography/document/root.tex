\title{Constructive Cryptography in HOL}
\author{Andreas Lochbihler and S. Reza Sefidgar}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Inspired by Abstract Cryptography~\cite{Maurer2011}, we
  extend CryptHOL~\cite{Basin2017, Lochbihler2017AFP}, a
  framework for formalizing game-based proofs, with an
  abstract model of Random Systems~\cite{Maurer2002} and
  provide proof rules about their composition and equality.
  This foundation facilitates the formalization of
  Constructive Cryptography~\cite{Maurer2011a} proofs, where
  the security of a cryptographic scheme is realized as a
  special form of construction in which a complex random
  system is built from simpler ones.  This is a first step
  towards a fully-featured compositional framework, similar
  to Universal Composability framework~\cite{Canetti2001},
  that supports formalization of simulation-based
  proofs~\cite{Goldwasser1989}.
