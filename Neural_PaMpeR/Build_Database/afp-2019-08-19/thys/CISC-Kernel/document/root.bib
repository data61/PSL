Early work was based on state machine and trace-set definitions; more recent work has dealt with definitions of security in two distinct process algebraic settings. Comparisons between the definitions has been carried out mainly within semantic frameworks. This paper studies the relationship between semantic frameworks, by defining mappings between a number of semantic models and studying the relationship between notions of noninterference under these mappings.

can show the absence of whole classes of security vulnerabilities. We
present the, to our knowledge, first complete, formal, machine-checked
verification of information flow security for the implementation of a
general-purpose microkernel; namely seL4. Unlike previous proofs of
information flow security for operating system kernels, ours applies
to the actual 8,830 lines of C code that implement seL4, and
so rules out the possibility of invalidation by implementation errors
in this code. We assume correctness of compiler, assembly code,
hardware, and boot code. We prove everything else. This proof is
strong evidence of seL4's utility as a separation kernel, and
describes precisely how the general purpose kernel should be
configured to enforce isolation and mandatory information flow
control. We describe the information flow security statement we proved
(a variant of intransitive noninterference), including the assumptions
on which it rests, as well as the modifications that had to be made to
seL4 to ensure it was enforced. We discuss the practical limitations
and implications of this result, including covert channels not covered
by the formal proof.
