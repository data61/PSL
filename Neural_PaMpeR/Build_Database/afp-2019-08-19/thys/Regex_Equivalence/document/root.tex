\title{Regular Expression Equivalence}
\author{Tobias Nipkow \and Dmitriy Traytel}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We formalize a unified framework for verified decision procedures for regular
  expression equivalence. Five recently published formalizations of such
  decision procedures (three based on derivatives, two on marked regular
  expressions) can be obtained as instances of the framework. We discover that
  the two approaches based on marked regular expressions, which were previously
  thought to be the same, are different, and one seems to produce uniformly
  smaller automata.  The common framework makes it possible to compare the
  performance of the different decision procedures in a meaningful way.

  The formalization is also described in a submitted paper draft
  \cite{NipkowT-urexp}.
