\title{Cost Analysis of QuickSort}
\author{Manuel Eberl}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We give a formal proof of the well-known results about the number of comparisons performed by two variants of QuickSort: first, the expected number of comparisons of randomised QuickSort (i.\,e. QuickSort with random pivot choice) is $2(n+1)H_n - 4n$, which is asymptotically equivalent to $2\,n\ln n$; second, the number of comparisons performed by the classic non-randomised QuickSort has the same distribution in the average case as the randomised one.
