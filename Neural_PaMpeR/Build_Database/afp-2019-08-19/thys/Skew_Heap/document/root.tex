\title{Skew Heap}
\author{Tobias Nipkow}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Skew heaps are an amazingly simple and lightweight implementation of
  priority queues. They were invented by Sleator and
  Tarjan~\cite{SleatorT-SIAM86} and have logarithmic amortized complexity.
  This entry provides executable and verified functional skew heaps.

The amortized complexity of skew heaps is analyzed in the AFP entry
\href{http://isa-afp.org/entries/Amortized_Complexity.shtml}{Amortized Complexity}.
