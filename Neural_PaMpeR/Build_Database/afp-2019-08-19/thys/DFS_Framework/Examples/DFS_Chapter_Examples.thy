chapter "Examples"
text \<open>
  This chapter contains examples of using the DFS Framework.
  Most examples are re-usable algorithms, that can easily be integrated into
  other (refinement framework based) developments.

  The cyclicity checker example contains a detailed description of how to 
  use the DFS framework, and can be used as a guideline for own 
  DFS-framework based developments.
