\title{Liouville Numbers}
\author{Manuel Eberl}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this work, we define the concept of Liouville numbers as well as the standard construction to obtain Liouville numbers and we prove their most important properties: irrationality and transcendence.

This is historically interesting since Liouville numbers constructed in the standard way where the first numbers that were proven to be transcendental. The proof is very elementary and requires only standard arithmetic and the Mean Value Theorem for polynomials and the boundedness of polynomials on compact intervals.
