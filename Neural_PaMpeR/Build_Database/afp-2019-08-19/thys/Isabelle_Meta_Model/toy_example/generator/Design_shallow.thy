In this example, we configure our package to execute tactic SML code
(corresponding to some generated \verb|.thy| file, @{file \<open>Design_deep.thy\<close>}
details how to obtain such generated \verb|.thy| file).
Since SML code are already compiled (or reflected) and bound with the native Isabelle API in
@{theory Isabelle_Meta_Model.Generator_dynamic_sequential}, nothing is generated in this theory.
The system only parses arguments given to meta-commands and immediately calls the corresponding 
compiled functions.

The execution time is comparatively similar as if tactics were written by hand,
except that the generated SML code potentially inherits all optimizations performed
by the raw code generation of Isabelle (if any).

The configuration in @{keyword "shallow"} mode is straightforward:
in this mode @{command generation_syntax} basically terminates in $O(1)$.
