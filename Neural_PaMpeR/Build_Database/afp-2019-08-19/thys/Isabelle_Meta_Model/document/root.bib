  abstract	= {The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is one of the few
		  modeling languages that is widely used in industry. While
		  UML is mostly known as diagrammatic modeling language
		  (e.g., visualizing class models), it is complemented by a
		  textual language, called Object Constraint Language (OCL).
		  OCL is based on a three-valued logic that turns UML into a
		  formal language. Unfortunately the semantics of this
		  specification language, captured in the "Annex A" of the
		  OCL standard, leads to different interpretations of corner
		  cases. We formalize the core of OCL: denotational
		  definitions, a logical calculus and operational rules that
		  allow for the execution of OCL expressions by a mixture of
		  term rewriting and code compilation. Our formalization
		  reveals several inconsistencies and contradictions in the
		  current version of the OCL standard. Overall, this document
		  is intended to provide the basis for a machine-checked text
		  "Annex A" of the OCL standard targeting at tool
		  implementors.},
