  abstract = {This article addresses the problem of designing memory-efficient algorithms
	for the verification of temporal properties of finite-state programs.
	Both the programs and their desired temporal properties are modeled
	as automata on infinite words (B{\"u}chi automata). Verification is then
	reduced to checking the emptiness of the automaton resulting from
	the product of the program and the property. This problem is usually
	solved by computing the strongly connected components of the graph
	representing the product automaton. Here, we present algorithms that
	solve the emptiness problem without explicitly constructing the strongly
	connected components of the product graph. By allowing the algorithms
	to err with some probability, we can implement them with a randomly
	accessed memory of size O(n) bits, where n is the number of states
	of the graph, instead of O(n log n) bits that the presently known
	algorithms require.},
