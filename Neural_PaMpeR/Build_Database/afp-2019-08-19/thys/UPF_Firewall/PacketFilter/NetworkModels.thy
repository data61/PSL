  One can think of many different possible address representations. In this distribution, we include 
  seven different variants:
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item DatatypeAddress: Three explicitly named addresses, which build up a network consisting of 
          three disjunct  subnetworks. I.e. there are no overlaps and there is no way to distinguish 
          between individual hosts within a network.
    \item DatatypePort: An address is a pair, with the first element being the same as above, and 
          the second being a port number modelled as an Integer\footnote{For technical reasons,
          we always use Integers instead of Naturals. As a consequence, the (test) specifications 
          have to be adjusted to eliminate negative numbers.}.
    \item adr\_i: An address in an Integer.
    \item adr\_ip: An address is a pair of an Integer and a port (which is again an Integer).
    \item adr\_ipp: An address is a triple consisting of two Integers modelling the IP address and 
          the port number, and the specification of the network protocol
    \item IPv4: An address is a pair. The first element is a four-tuple of Integers, modelling an 
          IPv4 address, the second element is an Integer denoting the port number.
    \item IPv4\_TCPUDP: The same as above, but including additionally the specification of the 
          network protocol.
  \end{itemize}

  The theories of each pf the networks are relatively small. It suffices to provide the required 
  types, a couple of lemmas, and - if required - a definition for the source and destination ports 
  of a packet.
