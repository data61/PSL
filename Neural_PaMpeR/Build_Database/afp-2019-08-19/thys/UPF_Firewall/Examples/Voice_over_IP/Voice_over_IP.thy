  In this theory we generate the test data for correct runs of the FTP protocol. As usual, we 
  start with definining the networks and the policy. We use a rather simple policy which allows 
  only FTP connections starting from the Intranet and going to the Internet, and deny everything 
  else. 
\<close>

definition 
  intranet :: "adr\<^sub>i\<^sub>p net" where
  "intranet = {{(a,e) . a = 3}}"

definition 
  internet :: "adr\<^sub>i\<^sub>p net" where
  "internet = {{(a,c). a > 4}}"

definition 
  gatekeeper :: "adr\<^sub>i\<^sub>p net" where
  "gatekeeper = {{(a,c). a =4}}"

definition 
  voip_policy :: "(adr\<^sub>i\<^sub>p,address voip_msg) FWPolicy" where
  "voip_policy = A\<^sub>U"

text\<open>
  The next two constants check if an address is in the Intranet or in the Internet respectively.
\<close>

definition 
  is_in_intranet :: "address  \<Rightarrow> bool" where
  "is_in_intranet a = (a = 3)"

definition 
  is_gatekeeper :: "address \<Rightarrow> bool" where
  "is_gatekeeper a =  (a = 4)"

definition 
  is_in_internet :: "address \<Rightarrow> bool" where
  "is_in_internet a =  (a > 4)"

text\<open>
  The next definition is our starting state: an empty trace and the just defined policy.
\<close>

definition 
  "\<sigma>_0_voip" ::  "(adr\<^sub>i\<^sub>p, address voip_msg) history \<times>
                 (adr\<^sub>i\<^sub>p, address voip_msg) FWPolicy" 
where                                     
  "\<sigma>_0_voip = ([],voip_policy)"

text\<open>
  Next we state the conditions we have on our trace: a normal behaviour FTP run from the intranet 
  to some server in the internet on port 21.

definition "accept_voip" ::  "(adr\<^sub>i\<^sub>p, address voip_msg) history \<Rightarrow> bool" where
          "accept_voip t =   (\<exists> c s g i p1 p2. t \<in> NB_voip c s g i p1 p2 \<and> is_in_intranet c

  The depth of the test case generation corresponds to the maximal length of generated traces,  
  4 is the minimum to get a full FTP protocol run.
