text\<open>
  The most basic firewall scenario; there is a personal PC on one side and the Internet on the 
  other.  There are two policies: the first one allows all traffic from the PC to the Internet and 
  denies all coming into the PC. The second policy only allows specific ports from the PC. This 
  scenario comes in three variants: the first one specifies the allowed protocols directly, the 
  second together  with their respective port numbers, the third one only with the port numbers.
