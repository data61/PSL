  This is the fourth scenario, slightly more complicated than the previous one, as we now also 
  model specific servers within one network. Therefore, we could not use anymore the modelling 
  using datatype synonym, but only use the one where an address is modelled as an
  integer (with ports). 

  Just for comparison, this theory is the same scenario with datatype synonym anyway, but with four 
  distinct networks instead of one contained in another. As there is no corresponding network model 
  included, we need to define a custom one.

  We only want to create test cases which are sent between the three main networks: e.g. not 
  between the mailserver and the dmz. Therefore, the constraint looks as follows. \
