  The simple system of a stateless packet filter is not enough to model all common real-world 
  scenarios. Some protocols need further actions in order to be secured.  A prominent example is 
  the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which is a popular means to move files across the Internet. 
  It behaves quite differently from most other application layer protocols as it uses a two-way 
  connection establishment which opens a dynamic port. A stateless packet filter would only have 
  the possibility to either always open all the possible dynamic ports or not to allow that 
  protocol at all. Neither of these options is satisfactory. In the first case, all ports above
  1024 would have to be opened which introduces a big security hole in the system, in the second 
  case users wouldn't be very happy. A firewall which tracks the state of the TCP connections on 
  a system does not help here either, as the opening and closing of the ports takes place on the 
  application layer. Therefore, a firewall needs to have some knowledge of the application 
  protocols being run and track the states of these protocols. We next model this behaviour.

  The key point of our model is the idea that a policy remains the same as before: a mapping from 
  packet to packet out. We still specify for every packet, based on its source and destination 
  address, the expected action.  The only thing that changes now is that this mapping is allowed 
  to change over time. This indicates that our test data will not consist of single packets but 
  rather of sequences thereof. 

  At first we hence need a state. It is a tuple from some memory to be refined later and the 
  current policy.

text\<open>Having a state, we need of course some state transitions. Such
  a transition can happen every time a new packet arrives. State
  transitions can be modelled using a state-exception monad.
