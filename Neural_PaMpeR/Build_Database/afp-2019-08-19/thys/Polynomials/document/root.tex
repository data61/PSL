\begin{abstract}
  We define multivariate polynomials over arbitrary (ordered)
  semirings in combination with (executable) operations like addition, multiplication,
  and substitution. We also define (weak) monotonicity of polynomials
  and comparison of polynomials where we provide standard estimations 
  like absolute positiveness or the more recent
  approach of \cite{NZM10}. Moreover, it is proven
  that strongly normalizing (monotone) orders
  can be lifted to strongly normalizing (monotone) orders over polynomials.

  Our formalization was performed as part of the \isafor/\ceta-system 
  \cite{CeTA}\footnote{\url{http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ceta}}
  which
  contains several termination techniques. The provided theories have been
  essential to formalize polynomial-interpretations \cite{L79,Rational}.

  This formalization also contains an abstract representation as coefficient functions with finite
  support and a type of power-products. If this type is ordered by a linear (term) ordering, various
  additional notions, such as leading power-product, leading coefficient etc., are introduced as
  well. Furthermore, a lot of generic properties of, and functions on, multivariate polynomials 
  are formalized, including the substitution and evaluation homomorphisms, embeddings of polynomial 
  rings into larger rings (i.e. with one additional indeterminate), homogenization and 
  dehomogenization of polynomials, and the canonical isomorphism between $R[X,Y]$ and $R[X][Y]$.
