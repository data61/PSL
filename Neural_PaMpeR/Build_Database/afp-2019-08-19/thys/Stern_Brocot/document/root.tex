\title{The Stern-Brocot Tree}
\author{Peter Gammie \and Andreas Lochbihler}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The Stern-Brocot tree contains all rational numbers exactly once and in their lowest terms.
  We formalise the Stern-Brocot tree as a coinductive tree using recursive and iterative specifications,
  which we have proven equivalent, and show that it indeed contains all the numbers as stated.
  Following Hinze, we prove that the Stern-Brocot tree can be linearised looplessly into Stern's
  diatonic sequence (also known as Dijkstra's fusc function) and that it is a permutation of the
  Bird tree.

  The reasoning stays at an abstract level by appealing to the uniqueness of solutions of
  guarded recursive equations and lifting algebraic laws point-wise to trees and streams using
  applicative functors.
