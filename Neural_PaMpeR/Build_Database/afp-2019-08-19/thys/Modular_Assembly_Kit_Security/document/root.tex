\title{An Isabelle/HOL Formalization of the Modular Assembly Kit for Security Properties}
\author{Oliver Bra\v{c}evac, Richard Gay, Sylvia Grewe,\\ Heiko Mantel, Henning Sudbrock, Markus Tasch}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	The \enquote{Modular Assembly Kit for Security Properties} (MAKS) is a
	framework for both the definition and verification of possibilistic
	information-flow security properties at the specification-level. 
	MAKS supports the uniform representation of a wide range of
	possibilistic information-flow properties and provides support for the
	verification of such properties via unwinding results and compositionality
	results. We provide a formalization of this framework in Isabelle/HOL.

\section{Introduction}

This is a formalization of the Modular Assembly Kit for Security Properties (MAKS) {\cite{inp:Mantel2000a,phd:Mantel2003}} in its version from {\cite{phd:Mantel2003}}. We provide a more detailed explanation on how key concepts of MAKS are formalized in Isabelle/HOL in {\cite{tr:GreweMantelTaschGaySudbrock2018a}}.

\section{Basic Definitions}
In the following, we define the notion of prefixes and the notion of projection.
These definitions are preliminaries for the remaining parts of the Isabelle/HOL formalization of MAKS.\\

\input{Prefix.tex}

\input{Projection.tex}

\section{System Specification}

\subsection{Event Systems}
We define the system model of event systems as well as the parallel composition operator for event systems provided as part of MAKS in {\cite{phd:Mantel2003}}.\\

\input{EventSystems.tex}

\subsection{State-Event Systems}
We define the system model of state-event systems as well as the translation from state-event systems to event systems provided as part of MAKS in {\cite{phd:Mantel2003}}.
State-event systems are the basis for the unwinding theorems that we prove later in this entry.\\

\input{StateEventSystems.tex}

\section{Security Specification}

\subsection{Views \& Flow Policies}
We define views, flow policies and how views can be derived from a given flow policy.\\

\input{Views.tex}

\input{FlowPolicies.tex}

\subsection{Basic Security Predicates}
We define all 14 basic security predicates provided as part of MAKS in {\cite{phd:Mantel2003}}.\\

\input{BasicSecurityPredicates.tex}

\subsection{Information-Flow Properties}
We define the notion of information-flow properties from {\cite{phd:Mantel2003}}.\\

\input{InformationFlowProperties.tex}

\subsection{Property Library}
We define the representations of several possibilistic information-flow
properties from the literature that are provided as part of MAKS in {\cite{phd:Mantel2003}}.\\

\input{PropertyLibrary.tex}

\section{Verification}

\subsection{Basic Definitions}
We define when an event system and a state-event system are secure given an information-flow property.\\

\input{SecureSystems.tex}

\subsection{Taxonomy Results}
We prove the taxonomy results from {\cite{phd:Mantel2003}}.\\

\input{BSPTaxonomy.tex}


\subsection{Unwinding}
We define the unwinding conditions provided in {\cite{phd:Mantel2003}} and prove the unwinding theorems from {\cite{phd:Mantel2003}} that use these unwinding conditions.\\

\subsubsection{Unwinding Conditions}
\input{UnwindingConditions.tex}

\subsubsection{Auxiliary Results}
\input{AuxiliaryLemmas.tex}

\subsubsection{Unwinding Theorems}
\input{UnwindingResults.tex}

\subsection{Compositionality}
We prove the compositionality results from {\cite{phd:Mantel2003}}.

\subsubsection{Auxiliary Definitions \& Results}
\input{CompositionBase.tex}
\input{CompositionSupport.tex}
