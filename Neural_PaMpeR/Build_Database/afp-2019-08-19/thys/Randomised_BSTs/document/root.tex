\title{Randomised Binary Search Trees}
\author{Manuel Eberl}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This work is a formalisation of the Randomised Binary Search Trees introduced by Mart\'{i}nez and Roura~\cite{martinez_roura}, including definitions and correctness proofs. Like randomised treaps, they are a probabilistic data structure that behaves exactly as if elements were inserted into a non-balancing BST in random order. However, unlike treaps, they only use discrete probability distributions, but their use of randomness is more complicated.
