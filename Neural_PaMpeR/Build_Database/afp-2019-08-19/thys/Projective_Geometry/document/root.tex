\title{Projective Geometry}
\author{Anthony Bordg}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We formalize the basics of projective geometry. \\ In particular, we give a proof of the so-called Hessenberg's theorem in projective plane geometry (see \cite{Bezem2008} for an alternative proof using a Coherent Logic prover in Prolog which generates Coq proof scripts). \\ We also provide a proof of the so-called Desargues's theorem based on an axiomatization~\cite{Magaud_2012} of (higher) projective space geometry using the notion of rank of a matroid. This last approach allows to handle incidence relations in an homogeneous way dealing only with points and without the need of talking explicitly about lines, planes or any higher entity.
