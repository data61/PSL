  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses foundations, basic concepts, and paradigms for the specification of and reasoning about interactive real-time systems, their interfaces, and architectures as well as their properties in terms of contracts. Contracts are structured into assumptions about the behavior of the operational context of systems and promises about the system behavior (in the literature also called assumption/guarantee or assumption/commitment specification patterns). A logical analysis of assumption/promise specifications is carried out based on a mathematical system model:
* From assumption/promise contracts two versions of interface specifications are derived and analysed.
* Safety and liveness properties for assumption/promise contracts are analysed.
* Healthiness conditions are worked out for assumption/promise contracts.
* From interaction specifications describing the interaction between two systems assumption/promise contracts for the involved systems are derived.
* Contracts for components in architectures are studied in terms of assumptions and promises and healthiness conditions are worked out that guarantee that assumptions for the composite systems guarantee the validity of the assumptions for components.
Based on the theoretical analysis more practical issues are dealt with for a systematic use of assumption/promise patterns in system specification and architecture design.},
