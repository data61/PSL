                  proof in higher-order logic (\acs{hol}), using the proof
                  assistant Isabelle2002. It is a tutorial for potential
                  users rather than a monograph for researchers. The book has
                  three parts.

                  1. Elementary Techniques shows how to model functional
                  programs in higher-order logic. Early examples involve
                  lists and the natural numbers. Most proofs are two steps
                  long, consisting of induction on a chosen variable followed
                  by the auto tactic. But even this elementary part covers
                  such advanced topics as nested and mutual recursion. 2.
                  Logic and Sets presents a collection of lower-level tactics
                  that you can use to apply rules selectively. It also
                  describes Isabelle/\acs{hol}'s treatment of sets, functions
                  and relations and explains how to define sets inductively.
                  One of the examples concerns the theory of model checking,
                  and another is drawn from a classic textbook on formal
                  languages. 3. Advanced Material describes a variety of
                  other topics. Among these are the real numbers, records and
                  overloading. Advanced techniques are described involving
                  induction and recursion. A whole chapter is devoted to an
                  extended example: the verification of a security protocol. },
